    "This notebook does as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads all of the responses in a dataframe and runs evaluations on the responses using an `LLM as a judge` that selects the best model, corresponding best response given the question and context, and the subjective evaluation/explanation for choosing that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Records metrics like the `p90, p95` latency, as well as `explanation` files as to why a given model was selected by the `LLM as a judge` and why other's were not based on correctness and relevancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses a `Final LLM as a summarizer` to parse through all of the subjective evaluations/explanations provided by the `LLM as a judge` and gives a final analysis on the trends, patterns spotted across the model performance and gives a summary of which model is preferred for a given use case/dataset"

This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth. However, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to various consequences such as rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.\\n</anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0>\\n\", \"\\n<anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0>\\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the Sun's radiation, preventing it from escaping back into space.

The early plum pudding model proposed by J.J. Thomson was challenged by the Rutherford gold foil experiment, which led to the development of the Rutherford atomic model or planetary model. This model suggested that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it. The Bohr model later incorporated quantum theory and the concept of quantized energy levels to explain the emission spectra of atoms.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth\\'s surface after being heated by the Sun\\'s visible and ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\\n\\n1. The Sun\\'s radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth\\'s atmosphere and reaches the surface.\\n\\n2. The Earth\\'s surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\\n\\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth\\'s surface.\\n\\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth\\'s surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\\n\\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth\\'s average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\\n\\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\\n\\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry.

This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect contradicted classical physics, which predicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with the intensity of the incident light. However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity.

This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the planet's average surface temperature would be around -18\\u00b0C (-0.4\\u00b0F), which is too cold for most life forms to survive.\\n\\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the Sun's visible and ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\\n\\n1. The Sun's radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface.\\n\\n2. The Earth's surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\\n\\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface.\\n\\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\\n\\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\\n\\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\\n\\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry.

They play a crucial role in many chemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\\n\\nThe role of catalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical reaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\\n\\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this by interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require less energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.\\n\\nThere are two main types of catalysts:\\n\\n1. Homogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, typically dissolved in a liquid solution or present as a gas. Examples include enzymes in biological systems and transition metal complexes in organic synthesis.\\n\\n2. Heterogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants, often solid catalysts interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants. Examples include solid metal catalysts used in petroleum refining, automotive catalytic converters, and industrial processes like the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis.\\n\\nCatalysts can significantly increase the rate of a chemical reaction, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This makes them essential in various industrial processes, where they improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation.\\n\\nCatalysts are also crucial in biological systems, where enzymes act as highly specific and efficient catalysts for numerous biochemical reactions, enabling life processes to occur at reasonable rates and under mild conditions.\\n\\nThe development and optimization of catalysts have been a major area of research in chemistry and chemical engineering, as they play a vital role in improving the sustainability, efficiency, and economic viability of many industrial processes, as well as in developing new technologies for energy production, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the role of catalysts in chemical reactions?\\n\\nAssistant:\\n```\\n\\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \\\"```\\\" below.

They play a crucial role in many chemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\\n\\nThe role of catalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical reaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\\n\\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this by interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require less energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.\\n\\nThere are two main types of catalysts:\\n\\n1. Homogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, typically dissolved in a liquid solution or present as a gas. Examples include enzymes in biological systems and transition metal complexes in organic synthesis.\\n\\n2. Heterogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants, often solid catalysts interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants. Examples include solid metal catalysts used in petroleum refining, automotive catalytic converters, and industrial processes like the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis.\\n\\nCatalysts can significantly increase the rate of a chemical reaction, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. This makes them essential in various industrial processes, where they improve efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation.\\n\\nCatalysts are also crucial in biological systems, where enzymes act as highly specific and efficient catalysts for numerous biochemical reactions, enabling life processes to occur at reasonable rates and under mild conditions.\\n\\nThe development and optimization of catalysts have been a major area of research in chemistry and chemical engineering, as they play a vital role in improving the sustainability, efficiency, and economic viability of many industrial processes, as well as in developing new technologies for energy production, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the role of catalysts in chemical reactions?\\n\\nAssistant:\\n```\\n\\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \\\"```\\\" below.

It is based on the principles of Newtonian mechanics and is governed by Newton's laws of motion, as well as concepts like energy, momentum, and force.\\n\\nClassical mechanics assumes that particles and objects have well-defined positions and velocities at any given time, and their behavior can be predicted with certainty using deterministic equations of motion. It is a highly successful theory that accurately describes the motion of large-scale objects in everyday situations and has been instrumental in many scientific and technological advancements.\\n\\nHowever, classical mechanics breaks down when dealing with phenomena at the atomic and subatomic scales, where the effects of quantum mechanics become significant.\\n\\nQuantum Mechanics:\\nQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales. It was developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that could not be explained by classical mechanics, such as the photoelectric effect, the behavior of atoms and molecules, and the wave-particle duality of matter and energy.\\n\\nQuantum mechanics introduces several key principles that are fundamentally different from classical mechanics:\\n\\n1. Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior (wave-particle duality).\\n2. The state of a particle is described by a wave function, which represents the probability of finding the particle in a particular state or position.\\n3. Particles can only have certain discrete energy levels, rather than a continuous range of energies (quantization of energy).\\n4. The act of measurement can affect the state of a particle (the uncertainty principle).\\n\\nQuantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in explaining and predicting the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has led to numerous technological advancements, such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computing.\\n\\nThe main differences between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are:\\n\\n1. Scale: Classical mechanics applies to macroscopic objects, while quantum mechanics deals with atomic and subatomic scales.\\n2. Determinism: Classical mechanics is deterministic, while quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic behavior and uncertainty.\\n3. Particle behavior: Classical mechanics treats particles as localized objects, while quantum mechanics describes particles as wave-like entities with probabilistic behavior.\\n4. Energy levels: Classical mechanics allows for continuous energy levels, while quantum mechanics introduces quantized energy levels.\\n\\nWhile classical mechanics remains valid for describing the motion of large-scale objects, quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics?\\n\\nAssistant:\\n```\\n\\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \\\"```\\\" below.
