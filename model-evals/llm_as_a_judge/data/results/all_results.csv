classical physics and could not be

orbiting around it. Later, the Bohr
model incorporated quantum theory and
quantized energy levels to explain the

Question: What is the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle?  Assistant:","The main difference between endothermic
and exothermic reactions is the
direction of energy flow and the
temperature changes associated with the
reaction. Endothermic reactions absorb
energy from the surroundings, resulting
in a decrease in the temperature of the
surroundings, while exothermic reactions
release energy to the surroundings,
causing an increase in the temperature
of the surroundings.","The main differences between classical
mechanics and quantum mechanics are:  1.
Scale: Classical mechanics applies to
macroscopic objects, while quantum
mechanics deals with atomic and
subatomic scales.  2. Determinism:
Classical mechanics is deterministic,
while quantum mechanics introduces
probabilistic behavior and uncertainty.
3. Particle behavior: Classical
mechanics treats particles as localized
objects, while quantum mechanics
describes particles as wave-like
entities with probabilistic behavior.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle
states that the position and momentum of
a particle cannot be measured precisely
at the same time, reflecting the wave-
particle duality of quantum particles.",1.018148,679,86,None,5.042923,702,94,None
