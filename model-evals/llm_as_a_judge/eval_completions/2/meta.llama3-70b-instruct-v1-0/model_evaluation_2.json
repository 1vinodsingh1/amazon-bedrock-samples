Use the following pieces of\nretrieved context in the section\ndemarcated by \"```\" to answer the\nquestion. If you don't know the answer\njust say that you don't know. Use three\nsentences maximum and keep the answer\nconcise.  ``` The greenhouse effect is a\nnatural process that occurs when certain\ngases in the Earth's atmosphere, known\nas greenhouse gases, trap heat from the\nSun's radiation and prevent it from\nescaping back into space. This process\nis essential for maintaining a habitable\ntemperature on Earth, as without it, the\nplanet's average surface temperature\nwould be around -18\u00b0C (-0.4\u00b0F), which is\ntoo cold for most life forms to survive.\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water\nvapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2),\nmethane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and\ncertain synthetic gases like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases\nabsorb and re-emit infrared radiation,\nwhich is a form of thermal energy\nemitted by the Earth's surface after\nbeing heated by the Sun's visible and\nultraviolet radiation.  The greenhouse\neffect works as follows:  1. The Sun's\nradiation, primarily in the visible and\nultraviolet wavelengths, passes through\nthe Earth's atmosphere and reaches the\nsurface.  2. The Earth's surface absorbs\nsome of this radiation and re-emits it\nas infrared radiation (thermal energy).\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\nabsorb and re-emit a portion of this\ninfrared radiation in all directions,\nincluding back towards the Earth's\nsurface.  4. This trapped infrared\nradiation warms the Earth's surface and\nlower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable\ntemperature for life.  While the\ngreenhouse effect is a natural and\nnecessary process, human activities,\nprimarily the burning of fossil fuels\n(coal, oil, and natural gas) and\ndeforestation, have significantly\nincreased the concentration of\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\nparticularly carbon dioxide. This\nenhanced greenhouse effect is causing\nthe Earth's average surface temperature\nto rise, leading to global warming and\nclimate change.  The consequences of\nglobal warming include rising sea levels\ndue to melting glaciers and ice caps,\nmore frequent and intense extreme\nweather events, changes in precipitation\npatterns, disruptions to ecosystems and\nbiodiversity, and potential impacts on\nagriculture and food production.\nAddressing global warming requires\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions\nthrough transitioning to renewable\nenergy sources, improving energy\nefficiency, protecting and restoring\nforests, and adopting sustainable\npractices in various sectors such as\ntransportation, agriculture, and\nindustry. International cooperation and\ncollective action are crucial to\nmitigating the effects of global warming\nand ensuring a sustainable future for\nour planet. ```  Question: What is the\ngreenhouse effect and how does it\ncontribute to global warming?
