Your task is to select the\nanswer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of\nrelevancy and correctness. Put the selected answer (without truncating it and\ngive the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for\nselecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3\nelements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select),\n\"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\".  Your\nexplanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is\nsimple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or\nwas not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should\nbe concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the\nselected one was selected.  ```   ```  Refer to the question demarcated by \"```\"\nbelow  ``` Question: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\"\nto answer the question.

Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.  ``` The\ngreenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the\nEarth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat from the Sun's\nradiation and prevent it from escaping back into space. This process is\nessential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the\nplanet's average surface temperature would be around -18\u00b0C (-0.4\u00b0F), which is\ntoo cold for most life forms to survive.  The primary greenhouse gases are water\nvapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and\ncertain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons\n(HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of\nthermal energy emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the Sun's\nvisible and ultraviolet radiation.  The greenhouse effect works as follows:  1.\nThe Sun's radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths,\npasses through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface.  2. The Earth's\nsurface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation\n(thermal energy).  3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a\nportion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the\nEarth's surface.  4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth's surface\nand lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.  While the\ngreenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities,\nprimarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and\ndeforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse\neffect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to\nglobal warming and climate change.  The consequences of global warming include\nrising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and\nintense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions\nto ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food\nproduction.  Addressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy\nefficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices\nin various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry.\nInternational cooperation and collective action are crucial to mitigating the\neffects of global warming and ensuring a sustainable future for our planet. ```\nQuestion: What is the greenhouse effect and how does it contribute to global\nwarming?
