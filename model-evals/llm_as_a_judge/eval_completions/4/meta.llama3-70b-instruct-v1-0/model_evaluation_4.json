In the early 20th century, the plum pudding\nmodel proposed by J.J. Thomson suggested that atoms were composed of a uniform\npositive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within it. However,\nthis model was challenged by the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment in 1911,\nwhere Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the guidance of Ernest Rutherford,\nbombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles.  The results of the Rutherford\nexperiment showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the\nfoil, while a few were deflected at large angles, which was unexpected according\nto the plum pudding model. Rutherford proposed a new model, known as the\nRutherford atomic model or the planetary model, which suggested that atoms have\na dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with negatively charged\nelectrons orbiting around it, similar to planets orbiting the Sun.  While the\nRutherford model was a significant improvement, it still had limitations and\ncould not explain the stability of atoms or the emission spectra of different\nelements. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom, known as the\nBohr model, which incorporated quantum theory and the concept of quantized\nenergy levels. According to the Bohr model, electrons can only occupy specific\nenergy levels or orbits around the nucleus, and they can move between these\nlevels by absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy in the form of\nphotons. This model successfully explained the emission spectra of hydrogen and\nother simple atoms. However, the Bohr model had limitations in explaining the\nbehavior of more complex atoms and molecules. In the 1920s, the development of\nquantum mechanics by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others provided a\nmore comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of atoms.  The\nquantum mechanical model of the atom describes electrons as existing in\nprobability clouds or orbitals around the nucleus, rather than in well-defined\norbits. The shape and energy of these orbitals are determined by solving the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the specific atom or molecule. ```  Question: What is\nthe structure of the atom and how was it determined?
