In the early 20th\ncentury, the plum pudding model proposed\nby J.J. Thomson suggested that atoms\nwere composed of a uniform positive\ncharge with negatively charged electrons\nembedded within it. However, this model\nwas challenged by the famous Rutherford\ngold foil experiment in 1911, where Hans\nGeiger and Ernest Marsden, under the\nguidance of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded\na thin gold foil with alpha particles.\nThe results of the Rutherford experiment\nshowed that most of the alpha particles\npassed straight through the foil, while\na few were deflected at large angles,\nwhich was unexpected according to the\nplum pudding model. Rutherford proposed\na new model, known as the Rutherford\natomic model or the planetary model,\nwhich suggested that atoms have a dense,\npositively charged nucleus at the\ncenter, with negatively charged\nelectrons orbiting around it, similar to\nplanets orbiting the Sun.  While the\nRutherford model was a significant\nimprovement, it still had limitations\nand could not explain the stability of\natoms or the emission spectra of\ndifferent elements. In 1913, Niels Bohr\nproposed a new model of the atom, known\nas the Bohr model, which incorporated\nquantum theory and the concept of\nquantized energy levels.  According to\nthe Bohr model, electrons can only\noccupy specific energy levels or orbits\naround the nucleus, and they can move\nbetween these levels by absorbing or\nemitting specific amounts of energy in\nthe form of photons. This model\nsuccessfully explained the emission\nspectra of hydrogen and other simple\natoms.  However, the Bohr model had\nlimitations in explaining the behavior\nof more complex atoms and molecules. In\nthe 1920s, the development of quantum\nmechanics by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Werner\nHeisenberg, and others provided a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the\nstructure and behavior of atoms.  The\nquantum mechanical model of the atom\ndescribes electrons as existing in\nprobability clouds or orbitals around\nthe nucleus, rather than in well-defined\norbits. The shape and energy of these\norbitals are determined by solving the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the specific\natom or molecule. ```  Question: What is\nthe structure of the atom and how was it\ndetermined?
