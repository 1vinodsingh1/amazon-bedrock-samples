The principle can be\nexpressed mathematically as:  \u0394x\u0394p \u2265 \u0127/2\nWhere: \u0394x is the uncertainty or\nimprecision in the measurement of the\nparticle's position \u0394p is the\nuncertainty or imprecision in the\nmeasurement of the particle's momentum \u0127\nis the reduced Planck constant\n(approximately 6.63 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u22c5s)  The\ninequality means that the product of the\nuncertainties in position and momentum\nmust be greater than or equal to a\ncertain value, which depends on the\nreduced Planck constant. The physical\ninterpretation of the uncertainty\nprinciple is that the more precisely you\ntry to measure the position of a\nparticle, the more uncertain its\nmomentum becomes, and vice versa. This\nis because the act of measuring or\nobserving a particle inevitably disturbs\nits properties to some extent.  The\nuncertainty principle has profound\nimplications in quantum mechanics and\nunderlies many of the strange and\ncounterintuitive behaviors observed at\nthe atomic and subatomic scales.
