Your\nexplanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is\nsimple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or\nwas not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should\nbe concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the\nselected one was selected.  ```   ```  Refer to the question demarcated by \"```\"\nbelow  ``` Question: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\"\nto answer the question.
