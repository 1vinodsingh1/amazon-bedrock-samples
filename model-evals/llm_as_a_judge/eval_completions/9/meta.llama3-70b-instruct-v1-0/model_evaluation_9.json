There are responses from different models\ncompleting that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the\nanswer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of\nrelevancy and correctness. Put the selected answer (without truncating it and\ngive the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for\nselecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3\nelements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select),\n\"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\".  Your\nexplanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is\nsimple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or\nwas not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should\nbe concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the\nselected one was selected.  ```   ```  Refer to the question demarcated by \"```\"\nbelow  ``` Question: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\"\nto answer the question. If you don't know the answer just say that you don't\nknow. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.  ``` In\nchemistry, chemical reactions can be classified as either endothermic or\nexothermic based on the energy changes that occur during the reaction process.\nThe main difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions lies in the\ndirection of energy flow and the temperature changes associated with the\nreaction.  Endothermic Reactions: Endothermic reactions are chemical processes\nthat absorb energy from the surroundings in the form of heat. In an endothermic\nreaction, the reactants require an input of energy to break existing bonds and\nform new bonds, resulting in an increase in the overall energy of the system.\nEndothermic reactions are characterized by the following:  1. Energy is absorbed\nfrom the surroundings, usually in the form of heat. 2. The temperature of the\nsurroundings decreases as energy is absorbed by the reaction. 3. The products\nhave a higher energy content than the reactants. 4. Endothermic reactions are\nnon-spontaneous and require an external energy source to proceed.  Examples of\nendothermic reactions include: - Melting of ice (H2O(s) \u2192 H2O(l)) -\nPhotosynthesis in plants - Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3 \u2192\nCaO + CO2)  Exothermic Reactions: Exothermic reactions are chemical processes\nthat release energy to the surroundings in the form of heat. In an exothermic\nreaction, the reactants have a higher energy content than the products, and the\nexcess energy is released to the surroundings as heat.  Exothermic reactions are\ncharacterized by the following:  1. Energy is released to the surroundings,\nusually in the form of heat. 2. The temperature of the surroundings increases as\nenergy is released by the reaction. 3. The products have a lower energy content\nthan the reactants. 4. Exothermic reactions are spontaneous and can occur\nwithout an external energy source.  Examples of exothermic reactions include: -\nCombustion reactions (e.g., burning of wood or fossil fuels) - Neutralization\nreactions (e.g., reaction between an acid and a base) - Respiration in living\norganisms  The difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions is\ncrucial in understanding and controlling chemical processes, as it determines\nthe energy requirements and temperature changes associated with the reaction.\nEndothermic reactions require an input of energy, while exothermic reactions\nrelease energy and can be used as a source of heat or energy. This knowledge is\nessential in various fields, such as chemistry, materials science, and energy\nproduction. ```  Question: What is the difference between endothermic and\nexothermic reactions?  Assistant: ```  Refer to the model completions demarcated\nby \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its\nmodel name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\".\nfor example, if a response is in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected\nmodel name is model_1. Do not add spaces between the selected model name. The\nselected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <> tags\naround the model response.  ``` Model responses:   <model_1> If you touch a\ncontainer that holds an endothermic process, it will feel cool to the touch. An\nexothermic process results when heat energy is released, decreasing the internal\nenergy of the system.
