Endothermic Reactions:\nEndothermic reactions are chemical\nprocesses that absorb energy from the\nsurroundings in the form of heat. In an\nendothermic reaction, the reactants\nrequire an input of energy to break\nexisting bonds and form new bonds,\nresulting in an increase in the overall\nenergy of the system.  Endothermic\nreactions are characterized by the\nfollowing:  1. Energy is absorbed from\nthe surroundings, usually in the form of\nheat. 2. The temperature of the\nsurroundings decreases as energy is\nabsorbed by the reaction. 3. The\nproducts have a higher energy content\nthan the reactants. 4. Endothermic\nreactions are non-spontaneous and\nrequire an external energy source to\nproceed.  Examples of endothermic\nreactions include: - Melting of ice\n(H2O(s) \u2192 H2O(l)) - Photosynthesis in\nplants - Thermal decomposition of\ncalcium carbonate (CaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2)\nExothermic Reactions: Exothermic\nreactions are chemical processes that\nrelease energy to the surroundings in\nthe form of heat. In an exothermic\nreaction, the reactants have a higher\nenergy content than the products, and\nthe excess energy is released to the\nsurroundings as heat.  Exothermic\nreactions are characterized by the\nfollowing:  1. Energy is released to the\nsurroundings, usually in the form of\nheat. 2. The temperature of the\nsurroundings increases as energy is\nreleased by the reaction. 3. The\nproducts have a lower energy content\nthan the reactants. 4. Exothermic\nreactions are spontaneous and can occur\nwithout an external energy source.\nExamples of exothermic reactions\ninclude: - Combustion reactions (e.g.,\nburning of wood or fossil fuels) -\nNeutralization reactions (e.g., reaction\nbetween an acid and a base) -\nRespiration in living organisms  The\ndifference between endothermic and\nexothermic reactions is crucial in\nunderstanding and controlling chemical\nprocesses, as it determines the energy\nrequirements and temperature changes\nassociated with the reaction.\nEndothermic reactions require an input\nof energy, while exothermic reactions\nrelease energy and can be used as a\nsource of heat or energy. This knowledge\nis essential in various fields, such as\nchemistry, materials science, and energy\nproduction. ```  Refer to the question\ndemarcated by \"```\" below  ``` Question:\nWhat is the difference between\nendothermic and exothermic reactions?\n```  Refer to the model completions\ndemarcated by \"```\" below.
