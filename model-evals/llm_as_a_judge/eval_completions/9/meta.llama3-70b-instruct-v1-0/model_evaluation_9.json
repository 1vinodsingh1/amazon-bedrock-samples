Use the following pieces of\nretrieved context in the section\ndemarcated by \"```\" to answer the\nquestion. If you don't know the answer\njust say that you don't know. Use three\nsentences maximum and keep the answer\nconcise.  ``` In chemistry, chemical\nreactions can be classified as either\nendothermic or exothermic based on the\nenergy changes that occur during the\nreaction process. The main difference\nbetween endothermic and exothermic\nreactions lies in the direction of\nenergy flow and the temperature changes\nassociated with the reaction.\nEndothermic Reactions: Endothermic\nreactions are chemical processes that\nabsorb energy from the surroundings in\nthe form of heat. In an endothermic\nreaction, the reactants require an input\nof energy to break existing bonds and\nform new bonds, resulting in an increase\nin the overall energy of the system.\nEndothermic reactions are characterized\nby the following:  1. Energy is absorbed\nfrom the surroundings, usually in the\nform of heat. 2. The temperature of the\nsurroundings decreases as energy is\nabsorbed by the reaction. 3. The\nproducts have a higher energy content\nthan the reactants. 4. Endothermic\nreactions are non-spontaneous and\nrequire an external energy source to\nproceed.  Examples of endothermic\nreactions include: - Melting of ice\n(H2O(s) \u2192 H2O(l)) - Photosynthesis in\nplants - Thermal decomposition of\ncalcium carbonate (CaCO3 \u2192 CaO + CO2)\nExothermic Reactions: Exothermic\nreactions are chemical processes that\nrelease energy to the surroundings in\nthe form of heat. In an exothermic\nreaction, the reactants have a higher\nenergy content than the products, and\nthe excess energy is released to the\nsurroundings as heat.  Exothermic\nreactions are characterized by the\nfollowing:  1. Energy is released to the\nsurroundings, usually in the form of\nheat. 2. The temperature of the\nsurroundings increases as energy is\nreleased by the reaction. 3. The\nproducts have a lower energy content\nthan the reactants. 4. Exothermic\nreactions are spontaneous and can occur\nwithout an external energy source.\nExamples of exothermic reactions\ninclude: - Combustion reactions (e.g.,\nburning of wood or fossil fuels) -\nNeutralization reactions (e.g., reaction\nbetween an acid and a base) -\nRespiration in living organisms  The\ndifference between endothermic and\nexothermic reactions is crucial in\nunderstanding and controlling chemical\nprocesses, as it determines the energy\nrequirements and temperature changes\nassociated with the reaction.\nEndothermic reactions require an input\nof energy, while exothermic reactions\nrelease energy and can be used as a\nsource of heat or energy. This knowledge\nis essential in various fields, such as\nchemistry, materials science, and energy\nproduction. ```  Question: What is the\ndifference between endothermic and\nexothermic reactions?  Assistant: ```\nRefer to the model completions\ndemarcated by \"```\" below. While giving\na response, always refer to the model\nusing its model name in the <> tags and\ndo not use terms like \"other model or\nthis model\". for example, if a response\nis in <model_1></model_1> tags, then the\nselected model name is model_1. Do not\nadd spaces between the selected model\nname. The selected model name should be\nexactly same as the model name in the <>\ntags around the model response.  ```\nModel responses:   <model_1> If you\ntouch a container that holds an\nendothermic process, it will feel cool\nto the touch.
