This\neffect was first observed by Heinrich\nHertz in 1887 and later explained by\nAlbert Einstein in 1905, for which he\nreceived the Nobel Prize in Physics in\n1921.  The photoelectric effect\ncontradicted classical physics, which\npredicted that the energy of the emitted\nelectrons should increase with the\nintensity of the incident light.\nHowever, experiments showed that the\nenergy of the emitted electrons depended\nonly on the frequency of the light and\nnot on its intensity. This observation\ncould not be explained by classical\nphysics and was a major puzzle at the\ntime.  Einstein's explanation of the\nphotoelectric effect was based on the\nconcept of light as a stream of\nparticles (photons) proposed by Max\nPlanck in 1900. Einstein proposed that\nlight is composed of discrete packets of\nenergy called photons, and each photon\nhas an energy proportional to its\nfrequency. When a photon strikes a metal\nsurface, it can transfer its energy to\nan electron in the metal, allowing the\nelectron to escape from the metal's\nsurface if the photon's energy is\ngreater than the work function (the\nminimum energy required to remove an\nelectron from the metal).  The\nphotoelectric effect provided strong\nexperimental evidence for the particle\nnature of light and the quantization of\nenergy, which were fundamental concepts\nin the development of quantum mechanics.\nIt demonstrated that light behaves as\nboth a wave and a particle, a concept\nknown as wave-particle duality, which is\na cornerstone of quantum theory.  The\nphotoelectric effect had several\nimportant implications:  1. It supported\nthe idea of quantization of energy,\nwhich led to the development of quantum\nmechanics and the understanding of\natomic and molecular structure. 2. It\nprovided experimental evidence for the\nexistence of photons and the particle\nnature of light, which was a departure\nfrom classical physics. 3. It laid the\nfoundation for the development of\nvarious technologies, such as\nphotodetectors, solar cells, and other\noptoelectronic devices.  The\nphotoelectric effect was a crucial\nexperiment that challenged the classical\nunderstanding of light and matter, and\nits explanation by Einstein using the\nconcept of photons and quantization of\nenergy was a significant step towards\nthe development of quantum mechanics,\none of the most important theories in\nmodern physics. ```  Question: What is\nthe photoelectric effect and how did it\ncontribute to the development of quantum\nmechanics?
