This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later\nexplained by Albert Einstein in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics in 1921.  The photoelectric effect contradicted classical physics, which\npredicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with the\nintensity of the incident light. However, experiments showed that the energy of\nthe emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its\nintensity. This observation could not be explained by classical physics and was\na major puzzle at the time.  Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect\nwas based on the concept of light as a stream of particles (photons) proposed by\nMax Planck in 1900. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets\nof energy called photons, and each photon has an energy proportional to its\nfrequency. When a photon strikes a metal surface, it can transfer its energy to\nan electron in the metal, allowing the electron to escape from the metal's\nsurface if the photon's energy is greater than the work function (the minimum\nenergy required to remove an electron from the metal).  The photoelectric effect\nprovided strong experimental evidence for the particle nature of light and the\nquantization of energy, which were fundamental concepts in the development of\nquantum mechanics. It demonstrated that light behaves as both a wave and a\nparticle, a concept known as wave-particle duality, which is a cornerstone of\nquantum theory.  The photoelectric effect had several important implications: 1.\nIt supported the idea of quantization of energy, which led to the development of\nquantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic and molecular structure. 2. It\nprovided experimental evidence for the existence of photons and the particle\nnature of light, which was a departure from classical physics. 3. It laid the\nfoundation for the development of various technologies, such as photodetectors,\nsolar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.  The photoelectric effect was a\ncrucial experiment that challenged the classical understanding of light and\nmatter, and its explanation by Einstein using the concept of photons and\nquantization of energy was a significant step towards the development of quantum\nmechanics, one of the most important theories in modern physics. ```  Question:\nWhat is the photoelectric effect and how did it contribute to the development of\nquantum mechanics?
