There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\nThe photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light of sufficient energy (above a certain threshold frequency) shines on it. This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\n\nThe photoelectric effect contradicted classical physics, which predicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with the intensity of the incident light. However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity. This observation could not be explained by classical physics and was a major puzzle at the time.\n\nEinstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect was based on the concept of light as a stream of particles (photons) proposed by Max Planck in 1900. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons, and each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency. When a photon strikes a metal surface, it can transfer its energy to an electron in the metal, allowing the electron to escape from the metal's surface if the photon's energy is greater than the work function (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal).\n\nThe photoelectric effect provided strong experimental evidence for the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy, which were fundamental concepts in the development of quantum mechanics. It demonstrated that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, a concept known as wave-particle duality, which is a cornerstone of quantum theory.\n\nThe photoelectric effect had several important implications:\n\n1. It supported the idea of quantization of energy, which led to the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic and molecular structure.\n2. It provided experimental evidence for the existence of photons and the particle nature of light, which was a departure from classical physics.\n3. It laid the foundation for the development of various technologies, such as photodetectors, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.\n\nThe photoelectric effect was a crucial experiment that challenged the classical understanding of light and matter, and its explanation by Einstein using the concept of photons and quantization of energy was a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics, one of the most important theories in modern physics.\n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the photoelectric effect and how did it contribute to the development of quantum mechanics?\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below.
