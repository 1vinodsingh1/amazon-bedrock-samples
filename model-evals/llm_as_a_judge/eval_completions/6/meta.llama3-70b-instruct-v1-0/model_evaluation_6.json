Use the following pieces of\nretrieved context in the section\ndemarcated by \"```\" to answer the\nquestion. If you don't know the answer\njust say that you don't know. Use three\nsentences maximum and keep the answer\nconcise.  ``` The second law of\nthermodynamics is one of the fundamental\nlaws of physics that governs the\nbehavior of energy and its\ntransformation in thermodynamic systems.\nIt is closely related to the concept of\nentropy, which is a measure of disorder\nor randomness in a system.  The second\nlaw states that in an isolated system,\nthe total entropy always increases over\ntime, and the process is irreversible.\nThis means that in a closed system,\nenergy tends to disperse and become more\ndisordered, and it is impossible to\ntransfer heat from a cooler object to a\nhotter object without doing work.  The\nmathematical expression of the second\nlaw is:  \u0394S \u2265 0  Where \u0394S is the change\nin entropy of the system. This\ninequality indicates that the entropy of\nan isolated system can never decrease;\nit can only increase or remain constant.\nThe concept of entropy is closely tied\nto the second law of thermodynamics.\nEntropy is a measure of the number of\nmicroscopic configurations or\narrangements that a system can have\nwhile still appearing the same\nmacroscopically. A system with a higher\nnumber of possible microscopic\nconfigurations has a higher entropy.  As\na system becomes more disordered or\nrandom, its entropy increases. For\nexample, when a gas expands into a\nlarger volume, its molecules become more\ndispersed and disordered, resulting in\nan increase in entropy.  The second law\nof thermodynamics has several important\nimplications:  1. It explains the\ndirection of natural processes:\nSpontaneous processes in an isolated\nsystem always proceed in the direction\nof increasing entropy, which is the most\nprobable or disordered state.  2. It\nsets limits on the efficiency of heat\nengines: The second law dictates that no\nheat engine can be 100% efficient, as\nsome energy is always lost as waste\nheat, increasing the overall entropy of\nthe universe.  3. It provides a\nfundamental basis for the arrow of time:\nThe increase in entropy over time gives\na direction to the flow of time,\ndistinguishing the past from the future.\n4. It has applications in various\nfields, such as chemistry, biology,\ninformation theory, and cosmology, where\nthe concept of entropy is used to\nunderstand the behavior of complex\nsystems.  The second law of\nthermodynamics and the concept of\nentropy are crucial for understanding\nthe behavior of energy and matter in the\nuniverse, as well as the limitations and\nefficiency of various processes and\nsystems. ```  Question: What is the\nsecond law of thermodynamics and how\ndoes it relate to entropy?
