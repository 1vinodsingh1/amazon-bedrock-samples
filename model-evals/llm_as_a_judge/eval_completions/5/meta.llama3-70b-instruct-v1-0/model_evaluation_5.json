Use three\nsentences maximum and keep the answer\nconcise.  ``` Catalysts are substances\nthat increase the rate of a chemical\nreaction without being consumed or\naltered in the process. They play a\ncrucial role in many chemical processes\nby providing an alternative pathway with\na lower activation energy, which is the\nminimum energy required for a reaction\nto occur.  The role of catalysts can be\nunderstood by considering the energy\nprofile of a chemical reaction. In an\nuncatalyzed reaction, reactants must\novercome a high activation energy\nbarrier to form the products. This\nenergy barrier is determined by the\nstrength of the bonds that need to be\nbroken and formed during the reaction.\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway\nwith a lower activation energy barrier,\nallowing the reaction to proceed more\neasily and at a faster rate. They do\nthis by interacting with the reactants\nand forming intermediate species that\nrequire less energy to undergo the\nnecessary bond rearrangements.  There\nare two main types of catalysts:  1.\nHomogeneous catalysts: These catalysts\nare in the same phase as the reactants,\ntypically dissolved in a liquid solution\nor present as a gas. Examples include\nenzymes in biological systems and\ntransition metal complexes in organic\nsynthesis.  2. Heterogeneous catalysts:\nThese catalysts are in a different phase\nfrom the reactants, often solid\ncatalysts interacting with gaseous or\nliquid reactants. Examples include solid\nmetal catalysts used in petroleum\nrefining, automotive catalytic\nconverters, and industrial processes\nlike the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia\nsynthesis.  Catalysts can significantly\nincrease the rate of a chemical\nreaction, sometimes by several orders of\nmagnitude. This makes them essential in\nvarious industrial processes, where they\nimprove efficiency, reduce energy\nconsumption, and minimize waste\ngeneration.  Catalysts are also crucial\nin biological systems, where enzymes act\nas highly specific and efficient\ncatalysts for numerous biochemical\nreactions, enabling life processes to\noccur at reasonable rates and under mild\nconditions.  The development and\noptimization of catalysts have been a\nmajor area of research in chemistry and\nchemical engineering, as they play a\nvital role in improving the\nsustainability, efficiency, and economic\nviability of many industrial processes,\nas well as in developing new\ntechnologies for energy production,\nenvironmental remediation, and chemical\nsynthesis. ```  Question: What is the\nrole of catalysts in chemical reactions?\nAssistant: ```  Refer to the model\ncompletions demarcated by \"```\" below.\nWhile giving a response, always refer to\nthe model using its model name in the <>\ntags and do not use terms like \"other\nmodel or this model\". for example, if a\nresponse is in <model_1></model_1> tags,\nthen the selected model name is model_1.\nDo not add spaces between the selected\nmodel name.
