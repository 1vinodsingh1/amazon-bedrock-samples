There are responses from different models\ncompleting that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the\nanswer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of\nrelevancy and correctness. Put the selected answer (without truncating it and\ngive the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for\nselecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3\nelements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select),\n\"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\".  Your\nexplanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is\nsimple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or\nwas not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should\nbe concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the\nselected one was selected.  ```   ```  Refer to the question demarcated by \"```\"\nbelow  ``` Question: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\"\nto answer the question.

Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.  ``` Catalysts\nare substances that increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being\nconsumed or altered in the process. They play a crucial role in many chemical\nprocesses by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy,\nwhich is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.  The role of\ncatalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical\nreaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation\nenergy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the\nstrength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier,\nallowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this\nby interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require\nless energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.  There are two main\ntypes of catalysts:  1. Homogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in the same\nphase as the reactants, typically dissolved in a liquid solution or present as a\ngas. Examples include enzymes in biological systems and transition metal\ncomplexes in organic synthesis.  2. Heterogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are\nin a different phase from the reactants, often solid catalysts interacting with\ngaseous or liquid reactants. Examples include solid metal catalysts used in\npetroleum refining, automotive catalytic converters, and industrial processes\nlike the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis.  Catalysts can significantly\nincrease the rate of a chemical reaction, sometimes by several orders of\nmagnitude. This makes them essential in various industrial processes, where they\nimprove efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste generation.\nCatalysts are also crucial in biological systems, where enzymes act as highly\nspecific and efficient catalysts for numerous biochemical reactions, enabling\nlife processes to occur at reasonable rates and under mild conditions.  The\ndevelopment and optimization of catalysts have been a major area of research in\nchemistry and chemical engineering, as they play a vital role in improving the\nsustainability, efficiency, and economic viability of many industrial processes,\nas well as in developing new technologies for energy production, environmental\nremediation, and chemical synthesis. ```  Question: What is the role of\ncatalysts in chemical reactions?  Assistant: ```  Refer to the model completions\ndemarcated by \"```\" below.

Do not add spaces between the selected model\nname. The selected model name should be exactly same as the model name in the <>\ntags around the model response.  ``` Model responses:   <model_1> A catalyst is\na substance that can be added to a reaction to increase the reaction rate\nwithout getting consumed in the process.
