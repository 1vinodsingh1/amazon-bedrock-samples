Use three\nsentences maximum and keep the answer\nconcise.  ``` Nuclear fission and\nnuclear fusion are two fundamental\nprocesses in nuclear physics that\ninvolve the transformation of atomic\nnuclei. While both processes release\nenormous amounts of energy, they differ\nin their underlying mechanisms and\napplications.  Nuclear Fission: Nuclear\nfission is the process of splitting a\nheavy atomic nucleus, typically a\nfissile isotope like uranium-235 or\nplutonium-239, into two or more lighter\nnuclei. This process is accompanied by\nthe release of a tremendous amount of\nenergy, as well as neutrons and other\nsubatomic particles.  In a nuclear\nfission reaction, a heavy nucleus\nabsorbs a neutron, becoming unstable and\nundergoing fission. The fission\nfragments (lighter nuclei) and the\nreleased neutrons can initiate a chain\nreaction, where the neutrons cause\nfurther fission events in other heavy\nnuclei, leading to a self-sustaining\nnuclear reaction.  Nuclear fission is\nthe principle behind nuclear power\nplants and nuclear weapons. In nuclear\npower plants, the controlled fission of\nuranium or plutonium is used to generate\nheat, which is then converted into\nelectricity. In nuclear weapons, the\nuncontrolled and rapid fission of\nfissile materials releases an enormous\namount of energy in the form of an\nexplosion.  Nuclear Fusion: Nuclear\nfusion is the process of combining two\nor more lighter atomic nuclei to form a\nheavier nucleus. This process releases a\ntremendous amount of energy due to the\nconversion of a small amount of mass\ninto energy, as described by Einstein's\nfamous equation, E = mc^2.  Fusion\nreactions typically involve the fusion\nof isotopes of hydrogen, such as\ndeuterium and tritium, to form helium\nnuclei. These reactions occur at\nextremely high temperatures and\npressures, which are necessary to\novercome the electrostatic repulsion\nbetween the positively charged nuclei.\n```  Question: What is the difference\nbetween nuclear fission and nuclear\nfusion?
