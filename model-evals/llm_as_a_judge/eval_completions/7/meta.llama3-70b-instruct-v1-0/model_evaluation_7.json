Your task is to select the\nanswer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of\nrelevancy and correctness. Put the selected answer (without truncating it and\ngive the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for\nselecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3\nelements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select),\n\"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\".  Your\nexplanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is\nsimple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or\nwas not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should\nbe concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the\nselected one was selected.  ```   ```  Refer to the question demarcated by \"```\"\nbelow  ``` Question: Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.\nUse the following pieces of retrieved context in the section demarcated by \"```\"\nto answer the question.

Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.  ``` Nuclear\nfission and nuclear fusion are two fundamental processes in nuclear physics that\ninvolve the transformation of atomic nuclei. While both processes release\nenormous amounts of energy, they differ in their underlying mechanisms and\napplications.  Nuclear Fission: Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a\nheavy atomic nucleus, typically a fissile isotope like uranium-235 or\nplutonium-239, into two or more lighter nuclei. This process is accompanied by\nthe release of a tremendous amount of energy, as well as neutrons and other\nsubatomic particles.  In a nuclear fission reaction, a heavy nucleus absorbs a\nneutron, becoming unstable and undergoing fission. The fission fragments\n(lighter nuclei) and the released neutrons can initiate a chain reaction, where\nthe neutrons cause further fission events in other heavy nuclei, leading to a\nself-sustaining nuclear reaction. Nuclear fission is the principle behind\nnuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. In nuclear power plants, the\ncontrolled fission of uranium or plutonium is used to generate heat, which is\nthen converted into electricity. In nuclear weapons, the uncontrolled and rapid\nfission of fissile materials releases an enormous amount of energy in the form\nof an explosion.  Nuclear Fusion: Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two\nor more lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a\ntremendous amount of energy due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into\nenergy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E = mc^2.  Fusion reactions\ntypically involve the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and\ntritium, to form helium nuclei. These reactions occur at extremely high\ntemperatures and pressures, which are necessary to overcome the electrostatic\nrepulsion between the positively charged nuclei. ```  Question: What is the\ndifference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?  Assistant: ```  Refer to\nthe model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always\nrefer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like\n\"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in\n<model_1></model_1> tags, then the selected model name is model_1. Do not add\nspaces between the selected model name. The selected model name should be\nexactly same as the model name in the <> tags around the model response.  ```\nModel responses:   <model_1> The phenomenon of nuclear fission.

Nuclear fission is the\nsplitting of heavy atomic nuclei, while nuclear fusion is the combining of\nlighter atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei. Both processes release large\namounts of energy, but they differ in their mechanisms and applications.
