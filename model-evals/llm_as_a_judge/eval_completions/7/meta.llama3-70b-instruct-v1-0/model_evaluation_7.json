There are responses from different models completing that task by answering the question below. Your task is to select the answer that best answers the question based on the task provided in terms of relevancy and correctness.\nPut the selected answer (without truncating it and give the complete answer within your response), model name and explanation for selecting the answer and not selecting other answer in a JSON as within 3 elements: \"best_match_answer\" (which contains the full answer you select), \"selected_model\" (which contains the model name), and \"explanation\". \nYour explanation should include both model name and answer description so that it is simple to understand which answer was generated by which model and why it was or was not selected. Do not give a lengthy \"explanation\". Your explanation should be concise in 1-2 sentences as to why other models were not selected and why the selected one was selected.\n\n```\nNuclear fission and nuclear fusion are two fundamental processes in nuclear physics that involve the transformation of atomic nuclei. While both processes release enormous amounts of energy, they differ in their underlying mechanisms and applications.\n\nNuclear Fission:\nNuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically a fissile isotope like uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into two or more lighter nuclei. This process is accompanied by the release of a tremendous amount of energy, as well as neutrons and other subatomic particles.\n\nIn a nuclear fission reaction, a heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron, becoming unstable and undergoing fission. The fission fragments (lighter nuclei) and the released neutrons can initiate a chain reaction, where the neutrons cause further fission events in other heavy nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining nuclear reaction.\n\nNuclear fission is the principle behind nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. In nuclear power plants, the controlled fission of uranium or plutonium is used to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity. In nuclear weapons, the uncontrolled and rapid fission of fissile materials releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of an explosion.\n\nNuclear Fusion:\nNuclear fusion is the process of combining two or more lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E = mc^2.\n\nFusion reactions typically involve the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, to form helium nuclei. These reactions occur at extremely high temperatures and pressures, which are necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.\n```\n\nRefer to the question demarcated by \"```\" below\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?\n```\n\nRefer to the model completions demarcated by \"```\" below. While giving a response, always refer to the model using its model name in the <> tags and do not use terms like \"other model or this model\". for example, if a response is in <dummy_model></dummy_model> tags, then the model name is 'dummy_model'\n\n```\nModel responses: \n\n<dummy_model>\nThe phenomenon of nuclear fission.
