    "## Evaluations Model Responses using _LLM as a judge_\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads all the responses from the previous inference step and runs evaluations on the responses using an _LLM as a judge_ that selects the best model, corresponding best response given the question and context, and the subjective evaluation/explanation for choosing that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Records metrics like the `p90, p95` latency, as well as `explanation` files as to why a given model was selected by the _LLM as a judge_ and why other's were not based on correctness and relevancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses a _Final LLM as a summarizer_ to parse through all of the subjective evaluations/explanations provided by the _LLM as a judge_ and gives a final analysis on the trends, patterns spotted across the model performance and gives a summary of which model is preferred for a given use case/dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "*The model to be used as a judge and the final analysis summarizer can be configured in the `llm_as_a_judge_info` and the `final_analysis_summarizer` sections in the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file.*"

The key\\npoints about the Heisenberg uncertainty\\nprinciple are:  1. It applies to pairs\\nof complementary variables, such as\\nposition and momentum, or energy and\\ntime.  2. The more precisely you measure\\none variable, the more uncertain the\\nother becomes. For example, the more\\nprecisely you measure a particle's\\nposition, the more uncertain its\\nmomentum becomes.  3. The uncertainty is\\nnot due to imperfect measurement\\ntechniques, but is a fundamental\\nproperty of quantum mechanics. It arises\\nfrom the wave-particle duality of\\nquantum particles.  4. The uncertainty\\nprinciple is expressed mathematically\\nas:  ΔxΔp ≥ h/4π  Where Δx is the\\nuncertainty in position, Δp is the\\nuncertainty in momentum, and h is\\nPlanck's constant.  The Heisenberg\\nuncertainty principle is a cornerstone\\nof quantum mechanics and has profound\\nimplications for our understanding of\\nthe behavior of matter at the atomic and\\nsubatomic scales.\\n</anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0>\\n\", \"\\n<anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0>\\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle,\\nformulated by the German physicist\\nWerner Heisenberg in 1927, states that\\nthere is a fundamental limit to the\\nprecision with which certain pairs of\\nphysical properties of a particle, such\\nas position and momentum, can be\\nsimultaneously measured or known.  The\\nprinciple can be expressed\\nmathematically as:  ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2  Where:\\nΔx is the uncertainty or imprecision in\\nthe measurement of the particle's\\nposition Δp is the uncertainty or\\nimprecision in the measurement of the\\nparticle's momentum ħ is the reduced\\nPlanck constant (approximately 6.63 ×\\n10^-34 J⋅s)  The inequality means that\\nthe product of the uncertainties in\\nposition and momentum must be greater\\nthan or equal to a certain value, which\\ndepends on the reduced Planck constant.\\nThe physical interpretation of the\\nuncertainty principle is that the more\\nprecisely you try to measure the\\nposition of a particle, the more\\nuncertain its momentum becomes, and vice\\nversa. This is because the act of\\nmeasuring or observing a particle\\ninevitably disturbs its properties to\\nsome extent.

      "model_responses: [\"\\n<anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0>\\nThe Schrödinger equation is a\\nfundamental equation in quantum\\nmechanics that describes the behavior of\\nparticles at the quantum level. It was\\nformulated by the Austrian physicist\\nErwin Schrödinger in 1925 and is\\nconsidered one of the most important\\nequations in physics.  The Schrödinger\\nequation is a partial differential\\nequation that relates the wave function,\\nwhich contains all the information about\\nthe quantum state of a particle, to the\\nparticle's energy and potential energy.\\nThe wave function is a mathematical\\nrepresentation of the particle's\\nbehavior and describes the probability\\nof finding the particle in a particular\\nstate or position.  The Schrödinger\\nequation is written as:  iℏ(∂Ψ/∂t) = ĤΨ\\nWhere: - i is the imaginary unit (√-1) -\\nℏ is the reduced Planck constant - Ψ\\n(psi) is the wave function - Ĥ is the\\nHamiltonian operator, which represents\\nthe total energy of the system  The\\nSchrödinger equation is used to solve\\nfor the wave function and energy levels\\nof particles in various systems, such as\\natoms, molecules, and solids. By solving\\nthe equation for a given potential\\nenergy function, physicists can\\ndetermine the allowed energy levels and\\nthe corresponding wave functions for the\\nsystem.

Nuclear Fusion: - Involves\\ncombining two or more lighter atomic\\nnuclei (e.g., hydrogen isotopes like\\ndeuterium and tritium) to form a heavier\\nnucleus. - Releases energy by converting\\na small amount of the mass of the fused\\nnuclei into a large amount of energy, as\\ndescribed by Einstein's equation E=mc^2.\\n- Requires extremely high temperatures\\n(millions of degrees) and pressures to\\novercome the electrostatic repulsion\\nbetween the positively charged nuclei. -\\nOccurs naturally in the core of stars,\\nwhere the extreme temperatures and\\npressures are present. - Not yet\\nachieved on a commercial scale on Earth,\\nbut it is the goal of fusion research\\nfor potential future energy production.\\nIn summary, fission splits heavy nuclei,\\nwhile fusion combines lighter nuclei.\\nFission is relatively easier to achieve\\nand is used in current nuclear\\ntechnology, while fusion requires\\nextreme conditions and is still a\\nsubject of ongoing research for\\npractical applications.\\n</anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0>\\n\"]\n",

Measurement:    - In\\nclassical mechanics, the act of\\nmeasurement does not affect the state of\\nthe system.    - In quantum mechanics,\\nthe act of measurement can affect the\\nstate of the particle or system, due to\\nthe uncertainty principle.

Determinism:\\nClassical mechanics is deterministic,\\nmeaning that if you know the initial\\nconditions (position, velocity, etc.) of\\na system, you can predict its future\\nbehavior with certainty. Quantum\\nmechanics, on the other hand, is\\nprobabilistic, meaning that it can only\\npredict the probability of different\\noutcomes.  3.

The more precisely you measure\\none variable, the more uncertain the\\nother becomes.

The uncertainty is\\nnot due to imperfect measurement\\ntechniques, but is a fundamental\\nproperty of quantum mechanics. It arises\\nfrom the wave-particle duality of\\nquantum particles.  4. The uncertainty\\nprinciple is expressed mathematically\\nas:  ΔxΔp ≥ h/4π  Where Δx is the\\nuncertainty in position, Δp is the\\nuncertainty in momentum, and h is\\nPlanck's constant.

The more precisely you measure\\none variable, the more uncertain the\\nother becomes.

The principle can be\\nexpressed mathematically as:  ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2\\nWhere: Δx is the uncertainty or\\nimprecision in the measurement of the\\nparticle\\'s position Δp is the\\nuncertainty or imprecision in the\\nmeasurement of the particle\\'s momentum ħ\\nis the reduced Planck constant\\n(approximately 6.63 × 10^-34 J⋅s)  The\\ninequality means that the product of the\\nuncertainties in position and momentum\\nmust be greater than or equal to a\\ncertain value, which depends on the\\nreduced Planck constant. The physical\\ninterpretation of the uncertainty\\nprinciple is that the more precisely you\\ntry to measure the position of a\\nparticle, the more uncertain its\\nmomentum becomes, and vice versa.

Quantization of energy:    -\\nEinstein\\'s explanation of the\\nphotoelectric effect was based on the\\nidea that light is composed of discrete\\npackets of energy called photons, and\\neach photon has an energy proportional\\nto its frequency.    - This concept of\\nthe quantization of energy was a\\ndeparture from the classical\\nunderstanding of energy as a continuous\\nquantity, and it was a crucial step\\ntowards the development of quantum\\nmechanics.  3. Wave-particle duality: -\\nThe photoelectric effect demonstrated\\nthat light behaves as both a wave and a\\nparticle, a concept known as wave-\\nparticle duality.    - This was a\\nfundamental principle in quantum\\nmechanics, which recognized that both\\nthe wave and particle models of light\\nand matter were necessary to fully\\nunderstand their behavior.  4.\\nFoundations of quantum mechanics:    -\\nThe photoelectric effect and its\\nexplanation by Einstein laid the\\ngroundwork for the development of\\nquantum mechanics, which revolutionized\\nour understanding of the behavior of\\natoms, molecules, and subatomic\\nparticles.    - The concepts of\\nquantization of energy and the particle\\nnature of light were essential in the\\nformulation of the principles of quantum\\nmechanics by physicists such as Niels\\nBohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin\\nSchrödinger.  In summary, the\\nphotoelectric effect was a crucial\\nexperiment that challenged the classical\\nunderstanding of light and matter, and\\nits explanation by Einstein using the\\nconcept of photons and quantization of\\nenergy was a significant step towards\\nthe development of quantum mechanics,\\none of the most important theories in\\nmodern physics. </anthropic.claude-3-\\nhaiku-20240307-v1:0>   <anthropic.claude\\n-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0> The\\nphotoelectric effect is a phenomenon in\\nwhich electrons are ejected from the\\nsurface of a metal when light of\\nsufficient energy (above a certain\\nthreshold frequency) shines on it. This\\neffect could not be explained by\\nclassical physics and was a major puzzle\\nuntil Albert Einstein provided an\\nexplanation in 1905, which contributed\\nsignificantly to the development of\\nquantum mechanics.  Here\\'s how the\\nphotoelectric effect and Einstein\\'s\\nexplanation led to the development of\\nquantum mechanics:  1. Observations from\\nthe photoelectric effect:    - The\\nemission of electrons from the metal\\nsurface depended on the frequency of the\\nincident light, not its intensity.    -\\nThere was a minimum frequency (threshold\\nfrequency) below which no electrons were\\nemitted, regardless of the light\\nintensity.    - The maximum kinetic\\nenergy of the emitted electrons\\nincreased linearly with the frequency of\\nthe incident light.  2. Einstein\\'s\\nexplanation:    - Einstein proposed that\\nlight is composed of discrete packets of\\nenergy called photons, and each photon\\nhas an energy proportional to its\\nfrequency (E = hf, where h is Planck\\'s\\nconstant and f is the frequency).    -\\nWhen a photon strikes a metal surface,\\nit can transfer its energy to an\\nelectron in the metal.    - If the\\nphoton\\'s energy is greater than the work\\nfunction (the minimum energy required to\\nremove an electron from the metal), the\\nelectron can be ejected from the\\nsurface.    - The maximum kinetic energy\\nof the ejected electrons depends on the\\nfrequency of the incident light, not its\\nintensity.  3. Implications and\\ncontributions to quantum mechanics:    -\\nEinstein\\'s explanation of the\\nphotoelectric effect provided strong\\nevidence for the quantization of energy,\\nwhich was a fundamental departure from\\nclassical physics.    - It supported the\\nidea that light exhibits both wave-like\\nand particle-like properties (wave-\\nparticle duality), a concept that became\\ncentral to quantum mechanics.    - The\\nconcept of photons and the quantization\\nof energy laid the foundation for the\\ndevelopment of quantum mechanics, which\\nwas further developed by physicists like\\nNiels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and\\nothers.    - The photoelectric effect\\ndemonstrated the limitations of\\nclassical physics in explaining\\nphenomena at the atomic and subatomic\\nlevels, paving the way for the\\ndevelopment of a new theory (quantum\\nmechanics) to describe the behavior of\\nmatter and energy at these scales.\\nEinstein\\'s explanation of the\\nphotoelectric effect, which introduced\\nthe concept of photons and quantization\\nof energy, was a crucial step in the\\ndevelopment of quantum mechanics. It\\nchallenged the classical understanding\\nof light and matter and provided\\nexperimental evidence for the particle\\nnature of light and the quantization of\\nenergy, which became fundamental\\nprinciples of quantum mechanics. </anthr\\nopic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0>  ```\\nOnly give the JSON format response and\\ndo not include any pre filler words.\\nMake sure your JSON response is a single\\nline with the opening and closing\\nbrackets placed correctly.
