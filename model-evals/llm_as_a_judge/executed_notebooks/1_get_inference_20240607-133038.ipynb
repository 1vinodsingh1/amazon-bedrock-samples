    "## Step 1: Invoke Bedrock Models to get _Inferences_ on a user provided Dataset\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates inferences on a user provided dataset, using Foundation models on Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses [Litellm](https://www.litellm.ai/) as an interface to interact with the Bedrock API\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses `Ray`, which is used to run inferences in an asynchronous manner\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Records metrics like the `p90, p95` latency, `prompt token counts`, `completion token counts`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Saves all the combined _model responses_ to user questions from the source dataset in a `all_results.csv` that is used later in the _evaluation step_ for the evaluation process."

       "  'system_prompt': \"The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, known as greenhouse gases, trap heat from the Sun's radiation and prevent it from escaping back into space. This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the planet's average surface temperature would be around -18°C (-0.4°F), which is too cold for most life forms to survive.\\n\\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the Sun's visible and ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\\n\\n1. The Sun's radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface.\\n\\n2. The Earth's surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\\n\\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface.\\n\\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\\n\\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\\n\\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\\n\\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry. International cooperation and collective action are crucial to mitigating the effects of global warming and ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.\",\n",

       "  'system_prompt': \"The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light of sufficient energy (above a certain threshold frequency) shines on it. This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect contradicted classical physics, which predicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with the intensity of the incident light. However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity. This observation could not be explained by classical physics and was a major puzzle at the time.\\n\\nEinstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect was based on the concept of light as a stream of particles (photons) proposed by Max Planck in 1900. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons, and each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency. When a photon strikes a metal surface, it can transfer its energy to an electron in the metal, allowing the electron to escape from the metal's surface if the photon's energy is greater than the work function (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal).\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect provided strong experimental evidence for the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy, which were fundamental concepts in the development of quantum mechanics. It demonstrated that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, a concept known as wave-particle duality, which is a cornerstone of quantum theory.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect had several important implications:\\n\\n1. It supported the idea of quantization of energy, which led to the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic and molecular structure.\\n2. It provided experimental evidence for the existence of photons and the particle nature of light, which was a departure from classical physics.\\n3. It laid the foundation for the development of various technologies, such as photodetectors, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect was a crucial experiment that challenged the classical understanding of light and matter, and its explanation by Einstein using the concept of photons and quantization of energy was a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics, one of the most important theories in modern physics.\",\n",

Thomson suggested that atoms were composed of a uniform positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within it. However, this model was challenged by the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment in 1911, where Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the guidance of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles.\\n\\nThe results of the Rutherford experiment showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a few were deflected at large angles, which was unexpected according to the plum pudding model. Rutherford proposed a new model, known as the Rutherford atomic model or the planetary model, which suggested that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it, similar to planets orbiting the Sun.\\n\\nWhile the Rutherford model was a significant improvement, it still had limitations and could not explain the stability of atoms or the emission spectra of different elements. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom, known as the Bohr model, which incorporated quantum theory and the concept of quantized energy levels.\\n\\nAccording to the Bohr model, electrons can only occupy specific energy levels or orbits around the nucleus, and they can move between these levels by absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy in the form of photons. This model successfully explained the emission spectra of hydrogen and other simple atoms.\\n\\nHowever, the Bohr model had limitations in explaining the behavior of more complex atoms and molecules. In the 1920s, the development of quantum mechanics by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others provided a more comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of atoms.\\n\\nThe quantum mechanical model of the atom describes electrons as existing in probability clouds or orbitals around the nucleus, rather than in well-defined orbits.

In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\\n\\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate.

Entropy is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations or arrangements that a system can have while still appearing the same macroscopically. A system with a higher number of possible microscopic configurations has a higher entropy.\\n\\nAs a system becomes more disordered or random, its entropy increases.

This process is accompanied by the release of a tremendous amount of energy, as well as neutrons and other subatomic particles.\\n\\nIn a nuclear fission reaction, a heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron, becoming unstable and undergoing fission.

However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity. This observation could not be explained by classical physics and was a major puzzle at the time.\\n\\nEinstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect was based on the concept of light as a stream of particles (photons) proposed by Max Planck in 1900. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons, and each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency.

However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity.

This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the planet's average surface temperature would be around -18°C (-0.4°F), which is too cold for most life forms to survive.\\n\\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the Sun's visible and ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\\n\\n1. The Sun's radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface.\\n\\n2. The Earth's surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\\n\\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth's surface.\\n\\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\\n\\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth's average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\\n\\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\\n\\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry. International cooperation and collective action are crucial to mitigating the effects of global warming and ensuring a sustainable future for our planet.\",\n",

However, this model was challenged by the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment in 1911, where Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the guidance of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles.\\n\\nThe results of the Rutherford experiment showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a few were deflected at large angles, which was unexpected according to the plum pudding model.
