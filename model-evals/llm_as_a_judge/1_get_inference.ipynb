    "This notebook does as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generates inferences on a user provided dataset, using Foundation models on Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses [Litellm](https://www.litellm.ai/) as an interface to interact with the Bedrock API\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses `Ray`, which is used to run inferences in an asynchronous manner\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Records metrics like the `p90, p95` latency, `prompt token counts`, `completion token counts`, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Saves all the combined _model responses_ to user questions from the source dataset in a `all_results.csv` that is used later in the _evaluation step_ for the evaluation process."

This process is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth, as without it, the planet\\'s average surface temperature would be around -18°C (-0.4°F), which is too cold for most life forms to survive.\\n\\nThe primary greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain synthetic gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, which is a form of thermal energy emitted by the Earth\\'s surface after being heated by the Sun\\'s visible and ultraviolet radiation.\\n\\nThe greenhouse effect works as follows:\\n\\n1. The Sun\\'s radiation, primarily in the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, passes through the Earth\\'s atmosphere and reaches the surface.\\n\\n2. The Earth\\'s surface absorbs some of this radiation and re-emits it as infrared radiation (thermal energy).\\n\\n3. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit a portion of this infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth\\'s surface.\\n\\n4. This trapped infrared radiation warms the Earth\\'s surface and lower atmosphere, maintaining a suitable temperature for life.\\n\\nWhile the greenhouse effect is a natural and necessary process, human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide. This enhanced greenhouse effect is causing the Earth\\'s average surface temperature to rise, leading to global warming and climate change.\\n\\nThe consequences of global warming include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and potential impacts on agriculture and food production.\\n\\nAddressing global warming requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions through transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and adopting sustainable practices in various sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and industry.

This effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 and later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect contradicted classical physics, which predicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with the intensity of the incident light. However, experiments showed that the energy of the emitted electrons depended only on the frequency of the light and not on its intensity. This observation could not be explained by classical physics and was a major puzzle at the time.\\n\\nEinstein\\'s explanation of the photoelectric effect was based on the concept of light as a stream of particles (photons) proposed by Max Planck in 1900. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete packets of energy called photons, and each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency. When a photon strikes a metal surface, it can transfer its energy to an electron in the metal, allowing the electron to escape from the metal\\'s surface if the photon\\'s energy is greater than the work function (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal).\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect provided strong experimental evidence for the particle nature of light and the quantization of energy, which were fundamental concepts in the development of quantum mechanics. It demonstrated that light behaves as both a wave and a particle, a concept known as wave-particle duality, which is a cornerstone of quantum theory.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect had several important implications:\\n\\n1. It supported the idea of quantization of energy, which led to the development of quantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic and molecular structure.\\n2. It provided experimental evidence for the existence of photons and the particle nature of light, which was a departure from classical physics.\\n3. It laid the foundation for the development of various technologies, such as photodetectors, solar cells, and other optoelectronic devices.\\n\\nThe photoelectric effect was a crucial experiment that challenged the classical understanding of light and matter, and its explanation by Einstein using the concept of photons and quantization of energy was a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics, one of the most important theories in modern physics.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the photoelectric effect and how did it contribute to the development of quantum mechanics?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Thomson suggested that atoms were composed of a uniform positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within it. However, this model was challenged by the famous Rutherford gold foil experiment in 1911, where Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the guidance of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a thin gold foil with alpha particles.\\n\\nThe results of the Rutherford experiment showed that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the foil, while a few were deflected at large angles, which was unexpected according to the plum pudding model. Rutherford proposed a new model, known as the Rutherford atomic model or the planetary model, which suggested that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with negatively charged electrons orbiting around it, similar to planets orbiting the Sun.\\n\\nWhile the Rutherford model was a significant improvement, it still had limitations and could not explain the stability of atoms or the emission spectra of different elements. In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a new model of the atom, known as the Bohr model, which incorporated quantum theory and the concept of quantized energy levels.\\n\\nAccording to the Bohr model, electrons can only occupy specific energy levels or orbits around the nucleus, and they can move between these levels by absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy in the form of photons. This model successfully explained the emission spectra of hydrogen and other simple atoms.\\n\\nHowever, the Bohr model had limitations in explaining the behavior of more complex atoms and molecules. In the 1920s, the development of quantum mechanics by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and others provided a more comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of atoms.\\n\\nThe quantum mechanical model of the atom describes electrons as existing in probability clouds or orbitals around the nucleus, rather than in well-defined orbits. The shape and energy of these orbitals are determined by solving the Schrödinger equation for the specific atom or molecule.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the structure of the atom and how was it determined?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

They play a crucial role in many chemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\\n\\nThe role of catalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical reaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\\n\\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this by interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require less energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.\\n\\nThere are two main types of catalysts:\\n\\n1. Homogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants, typically dissolved in a liquid solution or present as a gas. Examples include enzymes in biological systems and transition metal complexes in organic synthesis.\\n\\n2. Heterogeneous catalysts: These catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants, often solid catalysts interacting with gaseous or liquid reactants. Examples include solid metal catalysts used in petroleum refining, automotive catalytic converters, and industrial processes like the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis.\\n\\nCatalysts can significantly increase the rate of a chemical reaction, sometimes by several orders of magnitude.

It is closely related to the concept of entropy, which is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system.\\n\\nThe second law states that in an isolated system, the total entropy always increases over time, and the process is irreversible. This means that in a closed system, energy tends to disperse and become more disordered, and it is impossible to transfer heat from a cooler object to a hotter object without doing work.\\n\\nThe mathematical expression of the second law is:\\n\\nΔS ≥ 0\\n\\nWhere ΔS is the change in entropy of the system. This inequality indicates that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease; it can only increase or remain constant.\\n\\nThe concept of entropy is closely tied to the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations or arrangements that a system can have while still appearing the same macroscopically. A system with a higher number of possible microscopic configurations has a higher entropy.\\n\\nAs a system becomes more disordered or random, its entropy increases. For example, when a gas expands into a larger volume, its molecules become more dispersed and disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy.\\n\\nThe second law of thermodynamics has several important implications:\\n\\n1. It explains the direction of natural processes: Spontaneous processes in an isolated system always proceed in the direction of increasing entropy, which is the most probable or disordered state.\\n\\n2. It sets limits on the efficiency of heat engines: The second law dictates that no heat engine can be 100% efficient, as some energy is always lost as waste heat, increasing the overall entropy of the universe.\\n\\n3. It provides a fundamental basis for the arrow of time: The increase in entropy over time gives a direction to the flow of time, distinguishing the past from the future.\\n\\n4. It has applications in various fields, such as chemistry, biology, information theory, and cosmology, where the concept of entropy is used to understand the behavior of complex systems.\\n\\nThe second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy are crucial for understanding the behavior of energy and matter in the universe, as well as the limitations and efficiency of various processes and systems.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the second law of thermodynamics and how does it relate to entropy?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

While both processes release enormous amounts of energy, they differ in their underlying mechanisms and applications.\\n\\nNuclear Fission:\\nNuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically a fissile isotope like uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into two or more lighter nuclei. This process is accompanied by the release of a tremendous amount of energy, as well as neutrons and other subatomic particles.\\n\\nIn a nuclear fission reaction, a heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron, becoming unstable and undergoing fission. The fission fragments (lighter nuclei) and the released neutrons can initiate a chain reaction, where the neutrons cause further fission events in other heavy nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining nuclear reaction.\\n\\nNuclear fission is the principle behind nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. In nuclear power plants, the controlled fission of uranium or plutonium is used to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity. In nuclear weapons, the uncontrolled and rapid fission of fissile materials releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of an explosion.\\n\\nNuclear Fusion:\\nNuclear fusion is the process of combining two or more lighter atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein\\'s famous equation, E = mc^2.\\n\\nFusion reactions typically involve the fusion of isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, to form helium nuclei. These reactions occur at extremely high temperatures and pressures, which are necessary to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It is based on the principles of Newtonian mechanics and is governed by Newton\\'s laws of motion, as well as concepts like energy, momentum, and force.\\n\\nClassical mechanics assumes that particles and objects have well-defined positions and velocities at any given time, and their behavior can be predicted with certainty using deterministic equations of motion. It is a highly successful theory that accurately describes the motion of large-scale objects in everyday situations and has been instrumental in many scientific and technological advancements.\\n\\nHowever, classical mechanics breaks down when dealing with phenomena at the atomic and subatomic scales, where the effects of quantum mechanics become significant.\\n\\nQuantum Mechanics:\\nQuantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales. It was developed in the early 20th century to explain phenomena that could not be explained by classical mechanics, such as the photoelectric effect, the behavior of atoms and molecules, and the wave-particle duality of matter and energy.\\n\\nQuantum mechanics introduces several key principles that are fundamentally different from classical mechanics:\\n\\n1. Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior (wave-particle duality).\\n2. The state of a particle is described by a wave function, which represents the probability of finding the particle in a particular state or position.\\n3. Particles can only have certain discrete energy levels, rather than a continuous range of energies (quantization of energy).\\n4. The act of measurement can affect the state of a particle (the uncertainty principle).\\n\\nQuantum mechanics has been incredibly successful in explaining and predicting the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has led to numerous technological advancements, such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computing.\\n\\nThe main differences between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics are:\\n\\n1. Scale: Classical mechanics applies to macroscopic objects, while quantum mechanics deals with atomic and subatomic scales.\\n2. Determinism: Classical mechanics is deterministic, while quantum mechanics introduces probabilistic behavior and uncertainty.\\n3. Particle behavior: Classical mechanics treats particles as localized objects, while quantum mechanics describes particles as wave-like entities with probabilistic behavior.\\n4. Energy levels: Classical mechanics allows for continuous energy levels, while quantum mechanics introduces quantized energy levels.\\n\\nWhile classical mechanics remains valid for describing the motion of large-scale objects, quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the behavior of particles and systems at the atomic and subatomic scales, and it has revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy.\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The main difference between endothermic and exothermic reactions lies in the direction of energy flow and the temperature changes associated with the reaction.\\n\\nEndothermic Reactions:\\nEndothermic reactions are chemical processes that absorb energy from the surroundings in the form of heat. In an endothermic reaction, the reactants require an input of energy to break existing bonds and form new bonds, resulting in an increase in the overall energy of the system.\\n\\nEndothermic reactions are characterized by the following:\\n\\n1. Energy is absorbed from the surroundings, usually in the form of heat.\\n2. The temperature of the surroundings decreases as energy is absorbed by the reaction.\\n3. The products have a higher energy content than the reactants.\\n4. Endothermic reactions are non-spontaneous and require an external energy source to proceed.\\n\\nExamples of endothermic reactions include:\\n- Melting of ice (H2O(s) → H2O(l))\\n- Photosynthesis in plants\\n- Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3 → CaO + CO2)\\n\\nExothermic Reactions:\\nExothermic reactions are chemical processes that release energy to the surroundings in the form of heat. In an exothermic reaction, the reactants have a higher energy content than the products, and the excess energy is released to the surroundings as heat.\\n\\nExothermic reactions are characterized by the following:\\n\\n1. Energy is released to the surroundings, usually in the form of heat.\\n2. The temperature of the surroundings increases as energy is released by the reaction.\\n3. The products have a lower energy content than the reactants.\\n4.

They play a crucial role in many chemical processes by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, which is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur.\\n\\nThe role of catalysts can be understood by considering the energy profile of a chemical reaction. In an uncatalyzed reaction, reactants must overcome a high activation energy barrier to form the products. This energy barrier is determined by the strength of the bonds that need to be broken and formed during the reaction.\\n\\nCatalysts provide an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy barrier, allowing the reaction to proceed more easily and at a faster rate. They do this by interacting with the reactants and forming intermediate species that require less energy to undergo the necessary bond rearrangements.\\n\\nThere are two main types of catalysts:\\n\\n1.
