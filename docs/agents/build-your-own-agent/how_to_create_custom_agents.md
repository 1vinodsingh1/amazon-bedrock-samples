<h2>How to create your own Custom Agents</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/agents/build-your-own-agent/how_to_create_custom_agents.ipynb">Open in github</a>

<h2>Overview</h2>

We will be creating an agent from scratch using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. <strong>This is useful when the existing tools in popular frameworks don't support the type of agent you want to build, or if they have extra bit of code that you don't need for your specific use case or is slowing down your application. Building an agent from scratch also helps you understand how agents work internally.</strong>

Before we start, let's cover a few important concepts.

Agents are systems that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as their reasoning engines to decide what actions to take and what inputs to provide. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine if more actions are needed or if it's okay to finish.

Agents have access to different tools or functions that allow the LLM to interact with external APIs and automate tasks, resolve queries, and much more.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple agent from scratch that can access a web search engine and a Python code executor. We will be able to ask questions, watch the agent call the search tool and the Python code executor tool, and have a conversation with it.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

Following is the Architecture Daigram,

<!-- ![Custom Agent Architecture](./assets/custom_agent.drawio.png){align=center} -->
<!-- **Custom Agent Architecture**: Architecture explainging how an agent works. -->

When the user makes the query, the custom agent code receives it and then it orchestrates the interaction between the Foundational Model/LLM and its tools. These tools can be any custom code, Lambda Function, Database or even any Rest API hosted in the internet.

The custom agent code takes care of configuring the LLM calls such that LLM knows about the tools available to it, then it also takes care of function calling when the LLM deems them necessary and supplying the function responses back to LLM after receving the output back from the functions to generate the final answer.


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Apart from the libraries that we will be installing, this notebook will be utilizing the execution role attached with the Sagemaker Studio JupiterLab environment.

If you need help for creating execution role, for creating SageMaker Studio and JupiterLab environment, please refer to the following guides.

<ul>    
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">SageMaker Studio</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">SageMaker Role</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">SageMaker Jupiterlab</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Quick Start</a></li>
</ul>


```python
!pip install -Uq langchain_experimental==0.0.64 duckduckgo-search
```

<h2>Setup</h2>

We next import the required libraries


```python
import json
import io
from IPython.display import display
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS

import pprint
import random
import boto3
import sys
from io import StringIO
import copy

modelId = 'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0'
region = 'us-west-2'

session = boto3.session.Session(region_name=region)
bedrock_client = session.client('bedrock-runtime')
```

<h2>Code</h2>

We will now define the necessary subroutines for our agent to function. 

<h3>Defining the Tools</h3>

The first step in creating our Agent is to define the tools it can access. In our case, we'll be defining local Python functions, but it's important to note that these tools could be any type of application service. 

On AWS, these tools might include:
<ul>
<li>An AWS Lambda function</li>
<li>A connection to an Amazon RDS database</li>
<li>An Amazon DynamoDB table</li>
</ul>


Other examples of tools could be:
<ul>
<li>REST APIs</li>
<li>Data warehouses, data lakes, and databases</li>
<li>Computation engines</li>
</ul>


For our Agent, we'll define two tools as Python functions with the following abilities:
<ol>
<li>Retrieve web search results from the DuckDuckGo search engine using natural language as input.</li>
<li>Execute Python code provided by the Agent to generate charts using the Matplotlib library.</li>
</ol>


In simple terms, we're giving our Agent access to two tools: one that can perform web searches based on natural language queries, and another that can create visual charts and graphs from Python code. These tools will enable our Agent to gather information and present it in a visual format, which can be useful for various tasks and applications.


Following code defines two functions: `chat_generator_from_python_code` and `web_search`. The first function executes Python code to generate a chart, handling any exceptions and returning the result. The second function performs a web search using the DDGS (DuckDuckGo Search) library and returns the search results. Additionally, there's a `call_function` utility that will help us orchestrate the function calls by abstracting the tool name.


```python
from langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL

def chat_generator_from_python_code(code: str) -> str:
    """
    Function to executes the python code to generate the chart.
    Args:
        code: The python code that will generate the chart.
    """
    repl = PythonREPL()
    try:
        result = repl.run(code)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to execute. Error: {repr(e)}"
    result_str = f"Code has generated the chart successfully.\n{result}"
    return result_str


def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Function to research and collect more information to answer the query
    Args:
        query: The query that needs to be answered or more information needs to be collected.
    """
    try:
        results = DDGS().text(keywords=query, region='in-en', max_results=5)
        return '\n'.join([json.dumps(result) for result in results])
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to search. Error: {e}"


def call_function(tool_name, parameters):
    func = globals()[tool_name]
    output = func(**parameters)
    return output
```

Following is a sample execution of the web search function.


```python
query = "What is the capital of India"
print(f"Query for Web search: \n{query}")
data = call_function('web_search', {'query': query})

print(f"Following is the output of web search: {data}")
```

    Query for Web search: 
    What is the capital of India
    Following is the output of web search: {"title": "New Delhi | History, Population, Map, & Facts | Britannica", "href": "https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Delhi", "body": "New Delhi, national capital of India.It is situated in the north-central part of the country on the west bank of the Yamuna River, adjacent to and just south of Delhi city (Old Delhi) and within the Delhi national capital territory..

Now that we have functions defined that are to be used as tools, we will next define the `toolConfig` in the format required by the Bedrock Converse API to let Agent know about the tools available to it.

Within `toolConfig`, setting `toolChoice` to `{auto: {}}` allows the model to automatically decide if a tool should be called or whether to generate text instead.


```python
toolConfig = {
    'tools': [],
    'toolChoice': {
        'auto': {}
    }
}
```

The following is a sample of how a function-specific tool schema `toolSpec` of any function appears. The description fields allow the Large Language Models (LLMs) that support function calling to understand the tools available to them, specifically their functionality, when they should be used, and what types of parameter inputs they accept.


```python
toolConfig['tools'].append({
        'toolSpec': {
            'name': 'web_search',
            'description': 'Fetch information about any query from the internet.',
            'inputSchema': {
                'json': {
                    'type': 'object',
                    'properties': {
                        'query': {
                            'type': 'string',
                            'description': 'Query for which more information is required.'
                        }
                    },
                    'required': ['query']
                }
            }
        }
    })
```

<h3>Sample Custom Agent</h3>

Following `agent` class is designed to facilitate the interaction between a user and a language model (LLM) through a conversational interface. This implementation allows the LLM to call a single tool at a time, preventing it from getting stuck in a tool-calling loop. However, extending the functionality to plan and handle a series of tool calls can be implemented, albeit non-trivially.

The class initializes with a `toolConfig`, `system_prompt`, and an optional list of `messages`. The `call_converse_api_with_tools` method invokes the LLM by sending messages and the tool configuration, handling any exceptions that may occur.

The `handle_tool_use` method validates and calls the appropriate tool based on the provided tool name and parameters. If an unexpected tool is used, it raises an exception.

The `process_user_input` method is the core of the class. It appends the user's input to the list of messages, invokes the LLM, and processes the response. If the LLM's response includes tool usage instructions, the method calls the specified tool(s) and incorporates the tool's output into the conversation. This process continues until the LLM provides a final answer or the maximum number of retries is reached.

The `check_for_final_answer` method checks if the LLM's response includes a final answer to the user's query based on the conversation history.

The `invoke` method is the entry point for the user's input. It attempts to obtain a final answer by calling `process_user_input` and `check_for_final_answer` methods up to a maximum number of retries. If a final answer is not found within the specified number of retries, it returns the entire conversation history.

Overall, this agent class provides a conversational interface for users to interact with an LLM while enabling the LLM to leverage external tools. The implementation ensures that the LLM does not get stuck in a tool-calling loop by handling one tool at a time.

<h3>Testing Custom Agent with one tool</h3>

We will next test the agent that we defined before by providing it with previously defined `toolConfig` and a sample system prompt.

This `toolConfig` that we are providing our agent has one tool which can access the internet for web search.


```python
messages = []

system_prompt = """You are a researcher AI.
Your task is to use the tools available to you and answer the user's query to the best of your capabilities.
When you have final answer to the user's query then you are to strictly prefix it with FINAL ANSWER to stop the iterations."""

researcher_agent = agent(system_prompt=system_prompt, toolConfig=toolConfig, messages=messages)

output = researcher_agent.invoke("What is the GDP of India from 2009 to 2020")

print(output)

However, in 2020 India's GDP declined by 5.78% to $2.672 trillion likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.


It is evident that the Agent was capable of invoking the `web_search` tool, gathering the required information, and summarizing it to provide an answer to our query.

<h3>Testing Custom Agent with multiple tools</h3>

We shall test the agent by supplying multiple tools so and watch the it answer our queries.

    FINAL ANSWER: Based on the search results, here are the GDP figures for the USA from 2009 to 2021:
    
    2009: $14.628 trillion 
    2010: $14.992 trillion
    2011: $15.542 trillion
    2012: $16.197 trillion 
    2013: $16.785 trillion
    2014: $17.527 trillion
    2015: $18.224 trillion
    2016: $18.715 trillion
    2017: $19.519 trillion
    2018: $20.611 trillion
    2019: $21.428 trillion
    2020: $20.937 trillion (decline due to COVID-19 pandemic)
    2021: $23.000 trillion
    
    The GDP shows steady growth from 2009 to 2019, with a dip in 2020 likely caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the GDP rebounded strongly to reach $23 trillion.

    FINAL ANSWER: The line chart plotting the US GDP from 2009 to 2021 is shown below:
    
    [Chart Displaying Line Plot of US GDP from 2009 to 2021]
    
    The chart clearly shows the steady increase in US GDP year-over-year from 2009 to 2019, followed by a dip in 2020 likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. The GDP then rebounds strongly in 2021 crossing the $23 trillion mark.


<h2>Summary</h2>

In this notebook we saw how custom python functions can be defined as tools. We also saw a sample implementation of Custom Agent that works with two differnet tools. We interacted with the agent and watched it invoke different tools to as per user's requirements. 


<h2>Next Steps</h2>

You can append to the class to add the functionality to plan ahead and use multiple tools to achieve complex tasks. As an example you can checkout the next notebook <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/agents/build-your-own-agent/how_to_create_multi_agents_from_custom_agents.ipynb">how_to_create_multi_agents_from_custom_agents.ipynb</a> which talks about how by modifying our base class slightly we can do the the multi agent orchestration with it.



<h2>Cleanup</h2>

You can choose to delete the execution role, if you do not plan to use it again.


```python
