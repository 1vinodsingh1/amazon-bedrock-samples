### Agent for Insurance Claims Processing

Authors: Maira, Mark, Madhur

#### Overview

The Agent functionality is used here as an automated system designed to handle various tasks related to insurance claims. It integrates email communication with knowledge base (KB) information to provide comprehensive support in insurance claim management with all the open claims and their respective pending documents and missing requirements. This agent can look up claim details, identify outstanding paperwork, determine the requirements for these documents based on a Knowledge Base (KB), and send reminders via email.

### API Paths for Agent to refer to:

1. Claim Detail Retrieval
API Path: /claims/{claimId}/detail
Purpose: Fetches detailed information about a specific insurance claim, identified by claimId.
Response: Includes claim ID, creation date, last activity date, status, and policy type.

2. Open Claims Listing
API Path: /claims
Purpose: Lists all open insurance claims.
Response: Provides a list of open claims, including claim ID, policyholder ID, and claim status.

3. Outstanding Paperwork Identification
API Path: /claims/{claimId}/outstanding-paperwork
Purpose: Identifies any outstanding paperwork for a specific claim.
Response: Details the pending documents required for the claim.

4. Email Reminder for Outstanding Paperwork
API Path: /send-reminder
Purpose: Sends an email reminder to policyholders about outstanding documents and their requirements, based on information from the "insurance-claims-agent-kb" Knowledge Base.

### Agent's Workflow

#### Claim Information Retrieval: 

Upon receiving a request, the agent looks up specific claim details or lists open claims.

Outstanding Paperwork Check: The agent checks for any outstanding paperwork related to a claim.

Knowledge Base RAG: The agent accesses the "insurance-claims-agent-kb" to find detailed requirements for the outstanding documents.

#### Sending Email Reminders: 

Utilizing the emailsender action group, the agent composes and sends a detailed email to the relevant recipient(s), including all necessary information about the missing and pending documents.

Confirmation of Task Completion: Once the reminder is successfully sent, the agent confirms with the statement, "Reminder on claims and missing documents and requirements sent successfully."
