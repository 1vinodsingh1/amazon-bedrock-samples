    "<h2>How to create index and ingest documents in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code for building an empty OpenSearch Serverless (OSS) index in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base and then ingest documents into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Notebook Walkthrough</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we create a data pipeline that ingests documents (typically stored in Amazon S3) into a knowledge base i.e. a vector database such as Amazon OpenSearch Service Serverless (AOSS) so that it is available for lookup when a question is received.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). </li>\n",
    "<li>Ingestion - Knowledge base will split them into smaller chunks (based on the strategy selected), generate embeddings and store it in the associated vectore store.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/images/data_ingestion.png\" alt=\"Data Ingestion in Index of Knowledge Base\" style=\"margin:auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Steps:</h5>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Create Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base execution role with necessary policies for accessing data from S3 and writing embeddings into OSS.</li>\n",
    "<li>Create an empty OpenSearch serverless index.</li>\n",
    "<li>Download documents</li>\n",
    "<li>Create Amazon Bedrock knowledge base</li>\n",
    "<li>Create a data source within knowledge base which will connect to Amazon S3</li>\n",
    "<li>Start an ingestion job using KB APIs which will read data from s3, chunk it, convert chunks into embeddings using Amazon Titan Embeddings model and then store these embeddings in AOSS. All of this without having to build, deploy and manage the data pipeline.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is available in the Bedrock Knowledge Base then a question answering application can be built using the Knowledge Base APIs provided by Amazon Bedrock as demonstrated by other notebooks in the same folder.\n",
