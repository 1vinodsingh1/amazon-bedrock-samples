    "<h2>Building Q&A Application with Langchain and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Context</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing RAG requires organizations to perform several cumbersome steps to convert data into embeddings (vectors), store the embeddings in a specialized vector database, and build custom integrations into the database to search and retrieve text relevant to the user’s query. This can be time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, simply point to the location of your data in Amazon S3, and Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock takes care of the entire ingestion workflow into your vector database. If you do not have an existing vector database, Amazon Bedrock creates an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store for you. For retrievals, use the Langchain - Amazon Bedrock integration via the Retrieve API to retrieve relevant results for a user query from knowledge bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into building Q&A application. We will query the knowledge base to get the desired number of document chunks based on similarity search, integrate it with LangChain retriever and use Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku model from Amazon Bedrock for answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the Architecture Diagram of the orchestration done by Langchain by leveraging Large Language Model and Knowledge Base from Amazon Bedrock\n",

    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and ingested in vector database as shown on [0_how_to_create_index_and_ingest_documents_in_knowledge_base.ipynb](./0\\_how_to_create_index_and_ingest_documents_in_knowledge_base.ipynb). We will making use of the Knowledge Base ID that we stored in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are wanting to create the Knowledge Base from Console then you can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Dataset</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you will use several years of Amazon's Letter to Shareholders as a text corpus to perform Q&A on. This data is already ingested into the Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock. You will need the `knowledge_base_id` to run this example. In your specific use case, you can sync different files for different domain topics and query this notebook in the same manner to evaluate model responses using the retrieve API from knowledge bases.\n",

Concurrently, companies were stepping back and determining what they wanted to change coming out of the pandemic. Many concluded that they didn’t want to continue managing their technology infrastructure themselves, and made the decision to accelerate their move to the cloud. This shift by so many companies (along with the economy recovering) helped re-accelerate AWS’s revenue growth to 37% YoY in 2021.   Conversely, our Consumer revenue grew dramatically in 2020. In 2020, Amazon’s North America and International Consumer revenue grew 39% YoY on the very large 2019 revenue base of $245 billion; and, this extraordinary growth extended into 2021 with revenue increasing 43% YoY in Q1 2021. These are astounding numbers. We realized the equivalent of three years’ forecasted growth in about 15 months.   As the world opened up again starting in late Q2 2021, and more people ventured out to eat, shop, and travel, consumer spending returned to being spread over many more entities. We weren’t sure what to expect in 2021, but the fact that we continued to grow at double digit rates (with a two-year Consumer compounded annual growth rate of 29%) was encouraging as customers appreciated the role Amazon played for them during the pandemic, and started using Amazon for a larger amount of their household purchases.   This growth also created short-term logistics and cost challenges. We spent Amazon’s first 25 years building a very large fulfillment network, and then had to double it in the last 24 months to meet customer demand. As we were bringing this new capacity online, the labor market tightened considerably, making it challenging both to receive all of the inventory our vendors and sellers wanted to send us and to place that inventory as close to customers as we typically do.'),\n",

And, it’s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have AWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate to the cloud. As these equations steadily flip—as we’re already seeing happen—we believe our leading customer experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years. And, of course, this doesn’t include the other businesses and experiences we’re pursuing at Amazon, all of which are still in their early days.   I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at Amazon to make it so.   Sincerely,   Andy Jassy President and Chief Executive Officer Amazon.com, Inc.   P.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What’s written there is as true today as it was in 1997.        1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS (Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)   To our shareholders:   Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers, yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive competitive entry.   But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so, hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.   We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace.'),\n",

AWS is challenging to estimate because each customer’s workload is so different, but we’ll do it anyway, acknowledging up front that the error bars are high. Direct cost improvements from operating in the cloud versus on premises vary, but a reasonable estimate is 30%. Across AWS’s entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, that 30% would imply customer value creation of $19 billion (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS). The difficult part of this estimation exercise is that the direct cost reduction is the smallest portion of the customer benefit of moving to the cloud. The bigger benefit is the increased speed of software development – something that can significantly improve the customer’s competitiveness and top line. We have no reasonable way of estimating that portion of customer value except to say that it’s almost certainly larger than the direct cost savings. To be conservative here (and remembering we’re really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I’ll say it’s the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion in 2020.   Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion.        Summarizing: Shareholders $21B Employees $91B 3P Sellers $25B Customers $164B Total $301B   If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the “bottom lines” from those income statements. These numbers are part of the reason why people work for us, why sellers sell through us, and why customers buy from us. We create value for them. And this value creation is not a zero-sum game. It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you’ll find that invention is the root of all real value creation. And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation.')]\n"
