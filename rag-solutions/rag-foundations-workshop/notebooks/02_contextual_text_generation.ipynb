    "Question Answering (QA) is an important task that involves extracting answers to factual queries posed in natural language. Typically, a QA system processes a query against a knowledge base containing structured or unstructured data and generates a response with accurate information. Ensuring high accuracy is key to developing a useful, reliable and trustworthy question answering system, especially for enterprise use cases. However, in this notebook, we will highlight a well documented issue with LLMs: LLM's are unable to answer questions outside of their training data."

       "\n",
       "Inflation, the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, is a crucial economic indicator that can have far-reaching consequences on a country's economy. When inflation rises above a certain threshold, it can lead to a decline in the purchasing power of consumers, reduce savings, and increase uncertainty, ultimately affecting a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this article, we will explore the impact of high inflation on a country's GDP and examine the data to support our claims.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Relationship Between Inflation and GDP**\n",
       "\n",
       "Economists have long recognized the inverse relationship between inflation and GDP. When inflation is high, it can lead to a decline in real GDP, as the increased prices reduce the purchasing power of consumers and businesses. This is because high inflation can:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Reduce Consumer Spending**: As prices rise, consumers may delay purchases or switch to cheaper alternatives, leading to a decline in aggregate demand and, subsequently, a reduction in GDP.\n",
       "2. **Increase Production Costs**: Higher production costs due to inflation can lead to reduced competitiveness, lower profit margins, and, ultimately, a decline in economic activity.\n",
       "3. **Reduce Savings**: High inflation can erode the value of savings, leading to reduced consumer spending and investment, which can negatively impact GDP.\n",
       "4. **Increase Uncertainty**: High inflation can create uncertainty, leading to reduced investment, lower economic growth, and a decline in GDP.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Data Analysis**\n",
       "\n",
       "To illustrate the impact of high inflation on a country's GDP, let's examine the data from several countries with high inflation rates in recent years.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Argentina**: In 2020, Argentina experienced an inflation rate of 53.8%, one of the highest in the world. The country's GDP growth rate declined to 2.3% in 2020, down from 3.2% in 2019.\n",
       "* **Venezuela**: In 2020, Venezuela's inflation rate reached 10,000%, one of the highest in the world. The country's GDP contracted by 35.7% in 2020, its worst performance in decades.\n",
       "* **Turkey**: In 2020, Turkey's inflation rate reached 15.3%, prompting the Central Bank to raise interest rates to combat the inflationary pressures. The country's GDP growth rate slowed to 0.6% in 2020, down from 2.6% in 2019.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "The data clearly suggests that high inflation can have a devastating impact on a country's GDP. As prices rise, consumers and businesses become less confident, leading to reduced spending, investment, and economic activity. To combat high inflation, central banks and governments must implement policies that reduce inflationary pressures, such as monetary tightening, fiscal discipline, and structural reforms.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, high inflation is a significant threat to a country's economic stability and growth. It is essential for policymakers to prioritize inflation control and implement policies that promote economic stability and growth. By doing so, countries can mitigate the negative impact of high inflation on their GDP and ensure a more sustainable economic future."

       "Here is a summary of the plot of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald:\n",
       "\n",
       "The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who moves to New York to become a bond trader. He rents a house next door to a mysterious millionaire named Jay Gatsby. Nick is drawn into the wealthy Long Island social circle of his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan. \n",
       "\n",
       "Nick learns that Gatsby is in love with Daisy, with whom he had a romantic relationship years earlier before going off to war. Gatsby is incredibly wealthy from bootlegging and other shady business dealings. He throws lavish parties every weekend in hopes that Daisy will attend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nick arranges for Gatsby to reunite with Daisy, and they begin an affair. Tom grows suspicious of his wife's relationship with Gatsby. In a pivotal confrontation, Tom reveals that Gatsby's wealth comes from criminal activities. Daisy ends up leaving Gatsby after a dramatic incident.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the climax, Gatsby's dreams are crushed when Daisy chooses to remain with her husband Tom. Later that night, Gatsby's former love interest Myrtle Wilson is struck and killed by Gatsby's car, which Daisy was driving. George Wilson mistakenly believes Gatsby was the driver and shoots him dead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nick is deeply disillusioned by the carelessness and lack of compassion shown by the wealthy characters. Only Nick and a few others attend Gatsby's funeral. In the end, Nick returns to the Midwest, leaving the materialistic East behind."
