# Create Agents with Single Knowledge Base

In this folder, we provide an example of creating an agent for Amazon Bedrock that connects with a single Knowledge Base and with the Knowledge Base only. 

The agent developed here creates a Knowledge Base with the Amazon Bedrock documentation and allows users to ask questions about the documentation.
