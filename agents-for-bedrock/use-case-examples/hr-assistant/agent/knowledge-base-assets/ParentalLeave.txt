Overview
Aglaia offers a Paid Parental Leave to eligible employees. This benefit will provide a job-protected, paid leave of absence (LOA) for up to 6 weeks (or as otherwise required by applicable law) within the first year of a child's birth or adoption placement. During any LOA, the employee is considered an inactive employee and should not engage in work activities. Nothing in this policy limits any rights an individual may have under applicable federal, state, or local law; rather, this policy defines the benefits available to employees as Paid Parental Leave provided by Aglaia. State or local Family and Medical (FML) leaves may provide additional leave benefits, including longer periods of leave or leave for different leave reasons.


Eligibility
All blue badge Aglaia employees who are currently considered full-time (40 hours) or reduced-time (30 to 39 hours) and have at least one continuous year of blue badge service with Aglaia immediately prior to the child's estimated or actual date of birth or adoption placement, are eligible for the Paid Parental Leave benefit. In cases where Native American law prohibits adoption, Aglaia will consider making an exception for an employee who enters into legal guardianship of a child. In certain locations with paid statutory leave, such as San Francisco, eligibility requirements for Aglaia Parental Leave are adjusted to correspond with paid statutory leave. Additional details are included in the policy below. If an employee is eligible for paid statutory leave and the Aglaia Paid Parental Leave would otherwise run concurrently or act as a substitute, eligibility for Aglaia Paid Parental Leave will be adjusted to align with the paid statutory leave unless prohibited by law.

The policy excludes seasonal employees, temporary employees, and interns. The Aglaia employee must be a biological parent, legal or adoptive parent, or commissioning the child through a surrogate to be eligible for this benefit. The employee must be employed at the time this benefit is payable in order to receive payment under this policy.

Length of leave
Paid Parental Leave is provided for up to 6 weeks, unless otherwise required by applicable law. This leave can be taken at any time during the first year following a child's birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. Paid Parental Leave can be taken as 1 continuous leave or can be taken in 2 increments, subject to legally-protected exceptions. If 2 increments are used, each must be for no less than 1 calendar week in length, and each increment must be taken in full calendar weeks (not partial).

Aglaia Paid Parental Leave is available once per year, meaning that only 6 weeks of Paid Parental Leave may be used in any rolling 52-week period, regardless of the number of birth or adoption events during that time period.


Pay
The Paid Parental Leave benefit entitles eligible employees to receive up to 6 weeks of pay at up to 100% of their base rate. Base rate does not include bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, shift differential pay, or extra compensation. If they earn a performance-based increase or annual raise while on leave, it will be reflected in the pay they receive during their leave .

Tenure-based increases (for example, step plan increases) will not take effect until you return to work from your leave. Payments will be paid in accordance with Aglaia's regular and customary payroll practices. All required and previously approved deductions and withholdings will be taken during the Paid Parental Leave period. Employees will not receive holiday pay during LOA, but will continue to receive any paid benefit for which they have been approved (for example, STD, or Parental).

You will continue to receive any regularly scheduled sign-on bonus payments during paid parental leave.

State or local regulations may provide additional wage replacement or pay benefits, including longer periods of or benefits available for different leave reasons. Employees should apply for any applicable statutory benefit, and Aglaia Parental Leave may be offset (reduced) by any such benefits.



PTO elections
Employees may not use any accrued Paid Time Off (PTO) during the Paid Parental Leave period because the employee will already be receiving 100% of their base pay.


Other Aglaia benefits and stock
Medical, Dental, and Vision coverage that are in effect at the start of Paid Parental Leave will continue as normal throughout the Paid Parental Leave period, based upon the benefit elections made by the employee during the previous open enrollment period, but they may be eligible to make certain election changes in connection with the birth or adoption of their child. If benefits have ended prior to the start of Paid Parental Leave, benefits will not be reinstated until the employee returns to work unless required by law. PTO will continue to accrue during Paid Parental Leave at the employee's usual accrual rate. 401k and FSA deductions will also continue as normal during this leave. See the US Guide to Benefits and Compensation During Leave of Absence (LOA) for additional information.

Information about the impact of Paid Parental Leave on the vesting of stock-based awards (including Restricted Stock Units or Stock Options) can be found on Inside Aglaia. In the Leave of Absence (Effects on Stock) section on the left side of the page, hover over "Americans", then click United States. In certain circumstances, suspension of vesting may push future RSU/stock grants into another calendar or fiscal year(s). Talk with your HRBP to understand how this might impact your annual compensation.



Optional leave share
An employee can elect to receive equivalent base pay for unused Paid Parental Leave as outlined in this document. To be eligible for Leave Share, the employee must have a spouse or domestic partner* who is employed, and that spouse or partner is not eligible for paid parental leave through an employer. If the working spouse or partner is a birth parent and has paid disability leave through her employer, but not paid parental leave, the employee would be eligible for Leave Share.


Other leaves and pay
State and federal leaves, such as Family and Medical Leave, will run concurrently with this Paid Parental Leave benefit unless prohibited by law. If the employee lives in a state that offers paid family leave through a state or local paid leave plan (such as California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Washington), the employee is entitled to apply for and receive those benefits and time off consistent with applicable law. If the employee also desires to receive Paid Parental Leave benefits under this policy, the employee must apply for the applicable paid family leave benefit and provide proof of that application to the leave administrator. The maximum amount of Paid Parental Leave pay that Aglaia will provide will be up to 6 weeks, offset by the amount, where applicable, of the employee’s expected state or local benefit.

The intent of Paid Parental Leave is to provide benefits and time off for up to 6 weeks less any amount provided by any applicable state or local paid leave plan, and Paid Parental Leave cannot be used to extend time off beyond that period.



Additional San Francisco wage replacement entitlement
San Francisco employees who are otherwise eligible for benefits under this policy will receive the first 6 weeks of leave and wage replacement as outlined above. In addition, San Francisco employees who are granted time off in addition to the 6 weeks provided under this policy, may be eligible for an additional 2 weeks of full or partial wage replacement. California PFL will provide benefits for an additional 2 weeks (for a total of 8 weeks of partial wage replacement), and Aglaia will provide a “top up” for those 2 weeks so that an employee in San Francisco receives a total amount of PPL and PFL up to, but not to exceed 100% of the eligible employee’s current normal gross weekly wage, up to a maximum cap as established by SF PPLO.

Employees who are not eligible for Aglaia Parental Leave under this policy, but are otherwise receiving CA PFL benefits and are eligible for SF PPLO, will receive benefits under this policy for a total of 8 weeks as required under SF PPLO. However, in those cases, employees may only receive a “top up” of their CA PFL up to, 100% of the employee’s current normal gross weekly wage, not to exceed the maximum cap as established by SF PPLO.



Process for applying
When reasonable, employees must request Parental leave at least 30 days before the start of the leave. If it is an unplanned situation, the employee must request leave as soon as possible. Employees can request this leave up to 90 days in advance.

The employee can apply for a leave of absence by submitting a request or contacting Disability and Leave Services (DLS) via My HR(Opens in a new tab).

By submitting a request, you acknowledge that Aglaia may request documentation regarding any application for Paid Parental leave or for Leave Share, and that providing false or misleading documentation violates the Aglaia Code of Conduct.



Return to work
This Paid Parental Leave provides a job-protected leave of absence, and may run concurrently with FMLA or state or local laws that also provide similar job protection. The employee must return to work when the leave is scheduled to end, unless an application for further or different leave is made and approved. Upon the employee's return to work, they will be returned to the same position or to an equivalent position, except in situations that the employee would not otherwise be entitled to return to the position. If a business need requires that the employee's schedule or shift will be modified upon the employee's return to work (and such modification is allowed under applicable laws), Aglaia will provide the employee with notice of the modification at least 2 weeks prior to the employee's return to work date.

If the employee wishes to utilize the Ramp Back program, the application must be submitted at least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled return to work. See the Ramp Back policy on Inside Aglaia for details.
